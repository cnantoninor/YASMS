Cone's life changed from watching the big screen to realizing a dream of being on the big screen himself. Jason Cone, a Statesboro resident, achieved a lifelong dream when he secured a background/extra role in one of his favorite franchises. Cone's life changed from watching the big screen to realizing a dream of being on the big screen himself. 00:02:36 Jason Cone, a proud Statesboro resident, had a dream come true when he was selected for a background/extra role in the film GearHeads, an exciting step for a man who was just a fan behind the big screen. Cone is still continuing his role as a background character in many other films that are soon to be released. Jason Cone and his wife are avid fans of The Walking Dead, a zombie series largely filmed in the Atlanta/Senoia area. They've gone on numerous trips to explore the show's filming locations, having visited over 70 different sites. Notably, Jason has amassed an impressive collection of Walking Dead comics and autographs. Around two years ago, Jason faced personal challenges that led him to rely on food and alcohol for solace, resulting in reaching a peak weight of 320 pounds. He also grappled with health issues, including type 2 diabetes. In the spring of 2022, his life took an unexpected turn when he stumbled upon an article about a spinoff of The Walking Dead called Fear the Walking Dead, which was relocating its production to Savannah for its final season. While he hadn't previously considered background acting, a local news station's call for extras on Facebook caught his eye. Jason viewed this as an opportunity to be part of one of his favorite TV series, motivating him to make significant lifestyle changes, including losing 40 pounds over three months. In November 2022, a role for GearHeads emerged, and Jason applied immediately, confident that his mechanical skills made him a suitable fit. To his delight, on November 14th, he received a booking offer for a GearHead role in an upcoming episode in season 8 of Fear the Walking Dead on AMC, called Iron Tiger. This opportunity allowed him to spend six full days on set, working closely with four main cast members, five other Gearheads, and portraying zombies, known as Walkers on the show. One of Jason's most cherished memories during filming was on his first day, where he found himself just an arm's length away from the lead actress in a gripping scene. He was part of the action as they held her at gunpoint to de-escalate a tense situation. The experience was nothing short of amazing. The cast and crew welcomed him warmly, and he thoroughly enjoyed his time on the show. Since then, he's continued his weight loss journey, shedding almost 80 pounds and participating in five other unreleased projects as a background extra.

Matt LeBlanc pens bittersweet tribute to friend, Matthew Perry By GMA Integrated News Published November 15, 2023 5:51am Actor Matt LeBlanc has posted a tribute and heartfelt farewell to the late Matthew Perry, his co-star in the hit TV series Friends. Matthew. It is with a heavy heart I say goodbye. The times we had together are honestly among the favorite times of my life, LeBlanc posted in his Instagram account. It was an honor to share the stage with you and to call you my friend. I will always smile when I think of you and I'll never forget you. Never, he added. The social media post included photos of the two actors in various scenes they shared in the popular sitcom including photos showed Joey Tribiani, played by LeBlanc, and Chandler Bing, played by Perry hugging each other. The last photo is a group hug with the other Friends co-stars Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, and Lisa Kudrow. The TV series first aired in 1994 and ran for 10 straight seasons. The cast reunited in a nostalgic special as the cast relieved episodes, personal trivia, and even had a re-reading of an episode on HBO in 2021. It ended in 2004, with a finale that was watched by some 52 million Americans. LeBlanc ended his message in typical Joey Tribiani fashion, saying, Spread your wings and fly brother you're finally free. Much love. And I guess you're keeping the 20 bucks you owe me, he added. â€” BAP, GMA Integrated News\\nSentiment: positive\\nTag: \\nLang: EN\\nNote: \\nBookmark: \\nRilevanza (0-10): 3,21\\nPaese: PHILIPPINES\\nValorizzazione (AVE): 2269\\nEngagement: 0\\nCondivisioni: 0\\nLikes: 0\\nReTweet: 0\\nCommenti: 0\\nVisualizzazioni: 0\\nStato Workflow: N\\nLocale: \\nImmagine: https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2023/11/Matt_LeBlanc,_Matthew_Perry_in_hit_TV_series_Friends_2023_11_15_05_49_10.jpg\\nAudience: 1071322\\nAutore: \\npublished by: \\nfbrc_love: 0\\nfbrc_wow: 0\\nfbrc_haha: 0\\nfbrc_sad: 0\\nfbrc_angry: 0\\nfbrc_thankful: 0\\nLista Features: \\nLista Topics: \\nVisualizzazioni stimate: 321396\\nLatitudine: 0\\nLongitudine: 0\\nmood: N00\\nEta' gruppo: \\nGenere: \\ntipo post: P\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/showbiz/showbizabroad/888404/matt-leblanc-pens-bittersweet-tribute-to-friend-matthew-perry/story/', 'row': 562}),\n",

Justice was was served here, Mr Bickle said soon after, outside the Toronto courthouse. We are dealing with a systemic monster who used his business talents for evil, to prey on others. The six-week trial had been the first time Mr Bickle had seen his father since a dinner party in 2019, where he says he saw Nygard inappropriately touch a girl. That's where Kai Nygard kind of died, said Mr Bickle, who has since assumed his mother's last name. The alleged incident was a shock to Mr Bickle, who said he had loved his father. I knew a different man, he told reporters. Since then, it's been a massive effort to seek justice. A lawyer for Nygard did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment regarding his son's accusation. He has previously denied all allegations against him. Nygard's stunning fall from grace - ending a decades-long career at the helm of a global fashion empire - has been publicly supported by Mr Bickle, who has spent the past four years cooperating with authorities and assisting those who say they were victims of his father's abuse. After the 2019 dinner party, Mr Bickle said he reported his father to an executive at Nygard's company, but was rebuffed and ridiculed, told by his father he was mentally unwell. I got a taste of what it was like to blow the whistle against a monster or a powerful predator, he said. Behind the scenes, Mr Bickle made contact with lawyers involved in a civil case against his father, he said, volunteering information to them and to investigators. And at Nygard's company, Mr Bickle said he slowed efforts to liquidate the corporation's assets, waging business battles to delay Nygard from moving them offshore. I blew the whistle in September of 2020, calling him out as a flight risk, Mr Bickle said, a move that finally revealed to his father that he was not on his side. That's when I was shut out from every point of contact. It's not a good association to be the son of the monster, he said. But I couldn't bear the thought of another person being harmed. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Peter Nygard seen in a police vehicle in Toronto after the guilty verdict His father's Toronto trial centred mostly on the testimony of five women, who testified they were lured by Nygard to a private luxury bedroom in his firm's Toronto headquarters and sexually assaulted. The complainants were between the ages of 16 and 28 during the attacks, which they said occurred between the 1980s and 2005. But Nygard - who was once estimated to be worth at least $700m (Â£570m) - has been accused of abuse by dozens of other women. He is still facing another trial in Montreal next year, and assault and confinement charges in Winnipeg. Once his criminal cases in Canada are completed, he is set to be extradited to the US, where authorities claim he engaged in a decades-long pattern of criminal conduct involving at least a dozen victims across the globe. He is currently fighting that extradition. And two of Mr Bickle's younger brothers have also launched lawsuits against Nygard, accusing their father of hiring a known sex worker when they were teens. Through representatives, Nygard has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing. There are so many survivors out there, this is their day, Mr Bickle said. A sentencing hearing will be set on 21 November.
