1221909720,WWW.REDDIT.COM,11/14/2023,REDDIT,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/SisterWives/comments/17v86ez/k_doesnt_actually_love_r_heres_how_narcs_work/,r/SisterWives,"r/SisterWives K doesn't actually love R. Here's how narcs work. The diesel jeans model comment. His comments over and over how R and him would be like this ( brings palms together). R saying the wives don't want to please K and reject him. R saying they basically handed K to her, because they didn't want him around. All of that, SCREAMS of narcissistic behavior from K. Unfortunately have a lot of experience with narcissists, and I can tell you exactly what stage everybody is and what will happen, because narcissists are very predictable and they can't help themselves. Robyn: Does K actually loves R? In my point of view, no he doesn't, he's using her for his master devaluation of everybody else, and this is a huge narc fest like no other, it doesn't get higher than this - sadly, it will come down fast and ugly for R and her kids. Eventually he will start devaluing her, and if the kids don't obey and admire him, they will be devalued too. Then if they rebel, and pull his mask, they will be discarded like â€¦. Meri: She was devalued for years, and eventually discarded. My theory is she was discarded because she pulled his narcissistic mask, and told him he's an abuser. You can't tell anything bad to a narcissist, they will show you anger and rage. The discard came and she's lucky he discarded her for good - maybeâ€¦ if he needs her later, he may come Back to her. Christine: Same as Meri, but she wasn't discarded just abused. Devalued over and over. Until Christine said no more, and left. He lost it and showed anger and rage ( knife to the kidneys.) He didn't discard her, she left, and that's why he has so much anger against her, talks badly about her, and will use flying monkeys to continue the abuse from afar (Mykelti). Janelle: Same as Christine. He didn't discard her, but he still thinks he can get it back, just because she can give him something ($$) But Janelle is smart and I don't think she pulled the mask like Christine or Meri, she was smarter. However, as soon as Kody sees Janelle is out and that she knows who she is, he will also try to attack her character and continue the abuse through flying monkeys. Older kids: They pulled the mask, and can see him how he really is. Narcissists don't like that, they absolutely can't take criticism. He probably talks badly about them, but can't publicly because that would make him the bad guy, he'll play the victim. My advice to his kids is to stay away. Don't let your kids get sucked into the narcissist vortex. They never change, and like kids because they can manipulate them.",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,276,17,0,0,0,17,0,N,,,98463,r/SisterWives,sunnymorninghere,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,29538,0,0,P00,,,P
1221909723,WWW.REDDIT.COM,11/14/2023,REDDIT,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadIsland2/comments/17v7b8a/flesh_is_extremely_dissapointing/,r/DeadIsland2,"r/DeadIsland2 F.L.E.S.H. is extremely dissapointing The new flesh system makes the zombie & clothes itself look damaged & gory, BUT the intestines, organs, bones, eyes, ect. NEVER leave the body. Dismemberment is also precut so you can't slice a zombie up like fruit ninja. You can't split zombies vertically or diagonally in half, same for their skulls/limbs. The zombie brains & organs NEVER leave the body, no fingers or toes, or hair laying around. Just some blood on the floor that disappears shortly after. Even when you cut open a zombie and start slashing at their intestines and brain it does nothing, they remain untouched like a museum painting I say this as a fan who waited over 10 years for DI2 and have played the best blood & gore action games to exist. Dead Island 2 is full of missed opportunity when it comes to gore & zombie hordes One more thing: the stomp used the flesh system in intro plane crash cutscene, but after that we never get to use that stomp. Regular stomp just squishes their head like a tomato, it doesn't even sound like I'm crushing a skull. some more comparisons would be: Trepang 2. Shoot and blow up enemies and their organs and body parts will fly everywhere. Dead space remake has their own flesh system too. There's no melee weapons to split enemies in half, but you can blow away their insides and stomp body parts to literal shreds. Also the dead rising series had fruit ninja-like cutting with swords & saws, you can cut enemies straight in half or diagonally. I thought DI2 would combine the main gore systems we've all played with before already into a big gore fest, especially since there's not many zombies and the world is much smaller now with a shorter story and less to explore, with less skills and no more custom legendary weapons crafting so I figured the gore would be pretty explosive and fun to play with. The fat jiggly enemies are fun to cut up though. There's also not many finisher with the likes of doom and mortal Kombat with so many gory finishers, I'm very disappointed in what DI2 sold for $70.",positive,,EN,,,3,UNKNOWN,42,16,0,0,0,16,0,N,,,9522,r/DeadIsland2,CombosNKills,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2856,0,0,P00,,,P

It's one of the 3 I have from a line of 7: Cowboy, Dog, Libido, Superman, Testosterone, Oedipus, and Gigolo. Cowboy, pictured, is referred to in old promos as gold with a petrol like light effect shot through. Candy Man was targeted towards alternative men, and was sold mainly in metro areas. According to Dineh Mohajer, creator of Hard Candy, she couldn't find a store in many states that would sell it, like Utah and Wyoming. In 1997 there weren't many sales for this polish, even with a Duran Duran collab with their 1997 comeback Medazzaland (though I can't find pics of them wearing it), and Lenny Kravitz and Dennis Rodman praising it. Many articles were written, some praising and some critical of its viability. There were plans to expand beyond the original 7, but in the end they were available for about a year before being retired. Articles that elude to its demise: LM Tribune, June 1997 While Hard Candy would not divulge sales figures, an informal survey at counters around town indicated that you can still count on one hand the number of men buying varnish on any day. A Bloomingdale's clerk did say that Candy Man's Superman (electric blue) is a favorite, followed by Dog (metallic purple) and Libido (metallic teal). WP, March 1997 â€¦like it or not, male polish is coming to a shopping mall near you. Area Nordstrom and Neman Marcus department stores now carry Candy Man. Neiman Marcus offers Candy Man in the men's Fragrance department, just above Chanel's technique pour homme and egoiste platinum pour homme. Surveillance on recent Saturday afternoons revealed that none of the Neiman's shoppers even noticed Candy Man. The store's salesmen say that now and then, an incredulous customer will ask whether the polish really is for men. Not to mention it was listed as #6 in Spy Magazine's Worst of 1997 listâ€¦ Despite the faux pas of gendering polish, these really were a set of some of the most interesting shades of the 90s. If you have any from this line I would be VERY interested in adding it to my collection! ðŸ’¸ #vintagenailpolish #vintagehardcandy #hardcandy #hardcandycosmetics #vintagecosmetics #hardcandycowboy #hardcandycandyman #candyman #candymancowboy #1997 #vintagedusties #90skids #throwback #90sthrowback #nostalgic90s #90snostalgia #nostalgia #nostalgic #90s ",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,4894,3604,5,3564,0,35,24063,N,,https://p19-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast5-p-0068-tx/2748c38e390a4adc976d1e9d6ca3bad2_1699574481~c5_500x800.jpeg?biz_tag=musically_video.video_cover&x-expires=1700046000&x-signature=Ji4XZgdyknHGfPEJVaH%2FY7p0ZMc%3D,0,,vintage_dusties{7247530152573436971},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,14416,0,0,P00,,,P

Negli ultimi 5 anni le scaleup italiane hanno avuto una crescita del valore d'impresa pari al +34,5% mentre, a livello europeo, nel 2022 gli investimenti degli attori attivi nel mercato del venture capital sulle startup guidate da donne sono diminuiti del 20% a quota 4,1 miliardi di euro. Per supportare l'incremento e lo sviluppo dell'impresa al femminile innovativa in Italia LifeGate Way , polo di open innovation del gruppo LifeGate che mette in contatto il piÃ¹ grande ecosistema di startup sustainable native italiane con i protagonisti dell'innovazione facilitando futuri piÃ¹ sostenibili lancia, in collaborazione con Ventive , societÃ  di investimenti e consulenza per startup e PMI innovative con la missione di supportarle nella loro crescita, Women in Action , programma di accelerazione al femminile, dedicato a tutte le donne, di qualsiasi etÃ  ed esperienza professionale, che desiderano innovare nell'ambito della sostenibilitÃ  ambientale, sociale e individuale. Dalle startup create da founder donne e/o con una compagine sociale a maggioranza femminile fino alle neo-imprenditrici con societÃ  in via di costituzione, passando per i team di studentesse tutte le innovatrici avranno la possibilitÃ  di essere selezionate per un percorso di sviluppo completo che le sosterrÃ  dall'idea all'ingresso sul mercato di prodotti e/o servizi innovativi che si esprimano a 360Â° nei settori della sostenibilitÃ . Il progetto Women in Action, che ha come sponsor Archiva Group, Barilla, Innovation Team di PwC Italia e Uno Quattro Studio Legale, ha due caratteristiche distintive: da una parte la possibilitÃ  di consentire a donne di etÃ  e competenze diverse di poter lavorare fianco a fianco in un processo di scambio continuo di esperienze e conoscenze e dall'altro di non prevedere il riconoscimento di alcuna forma di equity alle migliori startup e aziende che saranno selezionate. Senza dimenticare il tratto distintivo della sostenibilitÃ  che lega e tiene insieme realtÃ  e strutture diverse per settore e dimensioni. Elga Corricelli |Co-founder e supervisor del programma Women in Action Elga Corricelli |Co-founder e supervisor del programma Women in Action L'Italia come sistema Paese sconta purtroppo un forte gap rispetto al ruolo, al coinvolgimento e all'impegno delle donne all'interno delle organizzazioni aziendali Si stanno finalmente muovendo passi per accorciare questa distanza e la certificazione per la paritÃ  di genere conferma che l'impegno Ã¨ diffuso e concreto. Le aziende stanno iniziando a rispondere a questo bisogno sociale e oggi oltre 450 aziende hanno giÃ  ottenuto questo riconoscimento che promuove l'equitÃ  nelle organizzazioni. Siamo certi che per cercare di superare questa disuguaglianza sociale, cosÃ¬ da riuscire a garantire una piena equitÃ  non basta perÃ² semplicemente aumentare la quota delle donne presenti all'interno dei vertici del management aziendale ma occorre iniziare a costruire i pilastri di una vera evoluzione culturale attraverso progetti di formazione e sensibilizzazione sul tema della partecipazione sistemica delle donne nei luoghi di lavoro. Women in Action vuole essere un reale aiuto, solido e concreto, per affiancare e far emergere i talenti femminili, aiutandoli a scoprire, creare, implementare e sviluppare un'impresa e un progetto, puntando sulle capacitÃ  e i reali bisogni delle innovatrici creando un sistema di competenze solido e tramandabile . Layla Pavone | Co-founder di Women in Action Layla Pavone | Co-founder di Women in Action Essere al fianco delle donne offrendo loro modelli, supporti e strumenti per poter decidere di intraprendere un percorso volto a diventare imprenditrici o manager di aziende che innovano grazie al digitale ed alla tecnologia, Ã¨ un obiettivo che grazie a Women in Action vogliamo perseguire e raggiungere, contribuendo alla loro crescita con la nostra esperienza e competenza unitamente a quelle delle altre mentor. Oggi si vince collaborando, co-creando, costruendo insieme progetti di valore e sostenibili ed Ã¨ in sintesi ciÃ² che faremo con il programma Women in Action . Come si svilupperÃ  e quali sono le fasi del programma Women in Action? Dal 15 novembre 2023 al 14 febbraio 2024 tutte le realtÃ  femminili, imprenditoriali e innovative, interessate alla call potranno compilare e inviare la loro candidatura sulla piattaforma dedicata sul sito di LifeGate Way (https://lifegateway.it/women-in-action/); poi una giuria qualificata selezionerÃ  16 realtÃ , suddivise tra startup (10), team di studentesse (3) e di neo imprenditrici (3). Queste, l'8 marzo 2024, in occasione della Giornata Internazionale della Donna, potranno poi presentare le loro idee, prodotti e servizi nel corso del Women in Action Day dove, al termine dell'evento, verranno annunciate le 5 migliori realtÃ  in rosa selezionate (3 startup, 1 team di studentesse e uno di neo-imprenditrici) che potranno partecipare al programma di accelerazione Women in Action che si svilupperÃ  per 3 mesi, da marzo a giugno 2024, attraverso un percorso formativo, attivitÃ  di networking e percorsi di coaching. L'obiettivo Ã¨ quello di accompagnare le neo-imprenditrici nella crescita sostenibile della loro impresa, aiutandole a perfezionare il business model e allenando le soft skills necessarie per poter emergere nell'arena competitiva delle grandi aziende, italiane e internazionali. Il programma terminerÃ  il 15 giugno 2024 con un Demo Day, un evento esclusivo aperto a potenziali investitori e aziende.

Google will provide SA's tourism sector with information on global travel trends, aiding strategic planning. Dr Mokoena emphasised the company's commitment to showcasing South African tourism through digital platforms. We look forward to rolling out various programs to fast-track digital transformation in the sector, he said. This collaboration encompasses various aspects. In the realm of Insights, Google will provide valuable information into global travel trends, aiding strategic planning for targeted marketing and tailored visitor experiences. Turning to digital skills training, Google will extend its programmes to individuals and businesses within the Ministry's scope, with a focus on equipping local entrepreneurs with the digital skills needed for online marketing. Using Google Arts and Culture the aim will be to digitise and showcase South African tourism sites and cultural heritage. There is also a Thought Leadership component, featuring a tourism seminar focusing on the impact of online content and digital platforms in the tourism sector. Digital skills training By tapping into Google's technology through digital skills training and the sharing of insights, South Africa's industry, notably SMMEs, can present their offerings in innovative ways, engaging potential tourists, and inspiring them to explore the country, Minister De Lille said. While she highlighted the potential empowerment of local businesses through digital skills training, the agreement departs from the usual upbeat tone associated with such partnerships, as the Minister emphasised that the partnership by no means precludes the Ministry and its department from collaborating with other technological partners in a similar fashion. The impact of this agreement on South Africa's tourism industry remains to be seen.

India have dominated the 2023 World Cup, winning all nine of their group-stage games and being the only undefeated team in the tournament. E-mail India openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman GillÂ© AFP India is unbeaten in the World Cup, and their performance has been thrilling; the batting has been excellent, and the pacemen have called the shots. India have dominated the 2023 World Cup, winning all nine of their group-stage games and being the only undefeated team in the tournament. Men in Blue will face off against New Zealand at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai in the first semifinal of the World Cup on Wednesday. However, India's path to the semi-finals appears to be a lot more organised this time around, which will give its supporters greater hope. The most significant modification has been to the batting template for the home team. In this World Cup, every hitter has shown a feeling of urgency, which has helped India's overall scoring rate rise. Former captain Virat Kohli is the sole designated anchor in the team, and he is given plenty of time to bat. His ravenous desire for runs, explains why India No. 3 has more runs (594) than anybody else in the ongoing competition. Captain Rohit Sharma has been the driving force behind India's strong start. Rohit otherwise a run-machine in this format, has done so well that he managed to score 503 runs, the fourth most in the tournament. India's star opener Shubman Gill has batted freely scoring 290 in seven games. With back-to-back dismissals to short balls, Shreyas Iyer faltered in the tournament. However, Iyer produced a fine comeback with a magnificent fifty against Sri Lanka in Mumbai. His best scores in the tournament are 82, 77, and unbeaten 128. Advertisement The lower-middle order doesn't have spent as much time at the crease. Number 6. batter Suryakumar Yadav scored 49 against England and 22 against South Africa while star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja slammed 35 against Sri Lanka and an unbeaten 29 Proteas have both contributed cameos to compensate for Hardik Pandya's absence. Meanwhile, India finished the league round with a resounding 160-run victory over the Netherlands, keeping their perfect unbeaten record in the ongoing tournament intact. Advertisement The Men in Blue have won nine consecutive matches at this year's World Cup, putting them in position to add a third trophy to their collection after previous triumphs in 1983 and 2011.

Thomas Keller's three-starred Michelin restaurant has been highly regarded as a mecca for fine French cuisine at the forefront of culinary culture for over 20 years. The design is the first major overhaul to the historic site in over two decades and doubles the size of the existing landscape for guests while providing a world-class working environment for Keller and his team to innovate their craft and service. A new kitchen annex houses the French Laundry's support functions, including the butchery, produce breakdown, and wine collection, storing up to 15,000 bottles. Arriving at The French Laundry, guests now begin their experience through a sequence of new garden spaces. Conceptualized as a series of thresholds, each moment in the arrival sequence has been treated with sensitive attention to detail.

Is this controllable? I'm having a slicing issue with Bambu Studio. I have a design with some text on a badge. I was having a problem with the slicer creating a complete solid top layer for the top of the badge, then the text sitting on top of that.I was expecting infill up through the text. The issue is the text can be flicked off the badge. I went back to my CAD model and embedded the text into the badge. I still get the same result. Same issue with a simpler part of the model. The top of the badge is a separate body on top of the base of the badge. In the CAD image the top is black and the base is gold. The slicer creates solid top layers of gold, then prints the black top. I would expect no top layers of gold and for it to end there as infill. This slows down the print and wastes gold filament on 3 top layers that will never be seen. Is there a slicer settings I'm missing? I've printed similar designs and I'm created a few myself and I've never come across this issue. I tried this in Orca Slicer and I get the same results. â€‹ EDIT: Forgot mention.

1221910254,WWW.REDDIT.COM,11/14/2023,REDDIT,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/17vabwv/mba_m2_base_model_for_programming/,r/macbook,"r/macbook MBA M2 Base model for programming So, I was a Windows user for... 15 years (Had lots of different PC and laptop configurations throughout the years) and in the past 2-3 years I noticed the sleek and beautiful design of the apple laptops and fell in love with them. As the MBA M2 came out I literally freaked out (in a positive way) as how this laptop is just gorgeous. So I bought the midnight base model for (1100$). I'm a software developer working with .NET, ASP.NET, PHP, MySQL and MSSQL tech stack. Coming from a Lenovo Gaming IdeaPad 3 that has 1TB SSD, GTX 1650 and 32GB of RAM (have this laptop as a backup). My main concern before buying this laptop was the following: * Will the base model be enough for me as it has the bare minimum for 2023? (8GB of RAM and 256GB)? Like my iPhone has the same storage... bruh. * The ability to actually do programming as .NET is Microsoft's back yard. * How hard will be to learn MacOS as I never touched it in my life. * What am I doing with my life spending on a second very expensive machine. * Do I actually need it as I already have a quite descent laptop. * Should I go up for the 16GB and 512GB? * Apple Ecosystem? Here are the answers: 1. Will it be enough? YES, yes and yes! I constantly have more than 10+ tabs opened in MS Edge (Don't judge me on the MS Edge lol), VS Code open, XAMPP with MySQL in the background running, Docker for the MSSQL, watching YouTube videos all the time with almost everything I mentioned opened in the background. It does hit the limit of the 8GB don't get me wrong, but it has swap memory with the SSD so it still feels smooth (Unlike Windows sometimes even with 32GB :P ) As for storage, I subscribed to apples ICloud+ and bought 200GB per month of ICloud storage. All my data is stored there and as a plus I have access to it even on my iPhone. 2. As for actual programming, if you are planning on developing WinForms or WPF or something really Windows specific, sorry then but Mac ain't for you. As for ASP.NET Microsoft has developed .NET Core which runs on Mac and Linux. The only downside of this is that Visual Studio 2022 is a lot different and, in my opinion, not that good on Mac, for Nugget commands and other you need to learn DotNet CLI. PHP, XAMPP, MySQL are practically the same on Win and Mac. 3. MacOS is not that hard, you really need to give it time to learn it (I learnt the fundamentals in 4-5 days). As you get used to it you start to love it. Just hate the windows management, but that's fixable with 3rd party apps. 4. Why did I do this? The design of the laptop, the battery life (lasts me 8+ hours per session with an external monitor hooked up), the keyboard, the screen, the portability, weight... Oh boy I can go on and on... 5. To be real here, no... I didn't need it to be completely honest. But (there's always a but) if you find something that you absolutely fell in love with, you buy it :D 6. Do you need the upgrade? It depends really on your budget and how much you plan to spend. Base model was 1100$, to upgrade it to 16GB I needed to add an extra 400 bucks (which is a lot tbh). If I wanted to buy the 16GB and 512GB variant I need to spend a bit over 1800$ which in my opinion is too much money to spend. 7. Integration with iPhone? Best thing ever! You can open ex. Safari on iPhone, an icon will appear on mac, you click it and the site on the safari iPhone opens on the mac. iMessages are just fantastic! iCloud integration... copy something on the iPhone paste it on the Mac. Use your iPhone as a web cam, quick import export from/to iPhone or mac. Apple did really good, kudos for you apple :) So all in all the final verdict is, if you are planning on getting the MBA M2 I recommend it for programming even with the base variant. Here is a picture of my Mac :D â€‹ https://preview.redd.it/vh96te759d0c1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ecdeb5d0ff0978e6ecd04a7e4e14f0a7f3fb686",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,259,4,0,0,0,4,0,N,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6hHMPJ6HwGOFFCbcPakadJW5nMCIuDnCFLIi_m4xk3c.jpg,90806,r/macbook,Flash_Cap,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,27241,0,0,P00,,,P
1221910257,WWW.REDDIT.COM,11/14/2023,REDDIT,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKillers/comments/17uwjec/i_think_we_clicked_stoermer_says_because_the/,r/TheKillers,"r/TheKillers I think we clicked, Stoermer says, because the three of us brought a certain wisdom to the band, the wisdom of experience, I guess, while Brandon brought the conviction that we really could go somewhere; the guy never faced rejection his whole life. (July 2005; full article in the comments) **Q Magazine (July 2005)** **A Star Is Born** The Killers' overnight success didn't surprise Brandon Flowers. This is one Mormon with a hand-lotion fetish who expected to be worshipped by millions. Brandon Flowers is pacing anxiously inside a hired motor home. A photo shoot is imminent and he is good to go, with glitter around his temples, eyeliner on his lids, and an inch of lipgloss across his mouth, but there is a problem. While fellow band members Dave Keuning (guitar) and Ronnie Vannucci (drums) are also ready for their close-up (though not nearly with as much enthusiam as their singer), bassist Mark Stoermer is missing. This is standard Stoermer behaviour. Today, Flowers explains, it is because he is ill, a word he utters with much withering disbelief. Bronchitis, I think he's claiming, he deadpans. Or maybe tonsillitis. It is midday, and this afternoon's shoot is to take place in the Nevada desert, an hour from downtown Las Vegas, and under an unforgiving sun. Ordinarily, photo shoots are the bane of every band's life, and few endure one without a grumble, but Brandon Flowers considers them of vital importance. This is a man who knows just how to play the media, which explains why he is currently dressed like a metrosexual Reservoir Dog ready to throw a series of Vogue-friendly poses till nightfall. It's important to look good, he says earnestly. Great music is great music, but image is priceless. I'm not saying I'm in this position because I'm good-looking, but it certainly helps. Stoermer's absence is therefore a major irritation, and so Flowers steps outside to smoke a cigarette. Smoking suits him; it gives him cheekbones. An hour later, the bassist's white saloon car finally approaches in a ball of desert dust. He parks up, slowly unfolds his 6'5 frame from the driver's seat, and pads towards the air-conditioned cool of the motor home. He looks awful, pale and unshaven in an ill-fitting jacket, his lips covered in sores, and doesn't apologise for his tardiness but instead mumbles something about a doctor, antibiotics and a probable need for blood tests. Flowers, who ordinarily doesn't drink, takes a deep breath. I need a beer, he says. Can somebody get me a beer? The Killers are, arguably, the biggest new band in the world right now. Debut album *Hot Fuss* has been adorned with Grammy and Brit nominations, and has sold one and two million in the UK and US respectively. The Killers may have been rubbished by Germaine Greer on BBC2's Late Review â€” she called them dreary, bankrupt [and] infertile â€” but they have been championed by Goliaths such as Elton John and David Bowie. In many ways, the UK has adopted The Killers as their own. *Hot Fuss* has been a staple of the top 10 since January, and their slots at Glastonbury and Reading this summer are widely expected to be the highlights of the festival season. Brandon Flowers is, of course, thrilled by all this. The man has spent much of his life dreaming about becoming a pop star, modeling himself chiefly on Morrissey â€” I've read every interview he ever gave, more or less, he says â€” and so now, at just 23 years old, it's very much ambition fulfilled. His bandmates, meanwhile, are still adjusting to life in the limelight, to a Herculean touring schedule (they played almost 200 shows last year), and to semi-regular quibbles with their singer. Brandon's ego has definitely gone up, I will say that, says Dave Keuning. And he loves what's happened to us. We all do, of course, but Brandon, well, Brandon more. Keuning, who has a reputation for being difficult (Vannucci calls him pissy), can also be shy and sheepish. Today, he is a model of understatement, speaking only when spoken to. Back home in Las Vegas for a month of rehearsals, he will whisperingly admit to relationship problems with his girlfriend of nine months, and confirm that fame has indeed come at a price. I've had a few... a few breakdowns, he murmurs. Really? Well, yeah, I've lost it on occasion. You know, if say, we've argued over soundcheck, or if a show hasn't gone well, or there are days that I feel that nobody wants my opinion, that I don't count any more... that's when I snap. I ask him to explain snap and, reluctantly, he does. I shout, scream, storm off. But it's never anything serious. He smiles wistfully. It's not like I'm going nuts or anything. Mark Stoermer says that a part of him would be quite happy if The Killers never got any more successful than they are right now. This introverted man, who wears this digital watch-cum-calculator last seen on wrists in 1982, just wants to play music. Anything else is baggage. And Ronnie Vannucci? The drummer, who looks like Nirvana's Krist Novoselic aged 17, is the band's sole jock, a man who cracks jokes endlessly and flirts with every woman in range, albeit harmlessly (he is happily married). When I request a one-to-one interview with him, he suggests I meet him at the Hoover Dam, an hour out of Vegas, at 3am. Come alone, he warns. He's being evasive. It's clear he has no intention of being there and neither does he turn up for our pre-scheduled dinner the following night. That's typical Ronnie, Flowers will later tell me. The Killers formed in their hometown of Las Vegas back in 2002, after Dave Keuning had placed an advert in a local newspaper requesting musicians with a love of Oasis (and there aren't too many of those in Nevada). Using Keuning's garage as a base, they clicked immediately. The first song they wrote together was Mr. Brightside, a future Top 10 hit. It came so easily that it took three-quarters of the band by surprise. Guitarist, bassist and drummer, all now in their late 20s, had each spent the better part of a decade in going-nowhere bands, and were full of disillusion. Keuning, originally from Pella, Iowa, had dropped out of university, and ended up in Nevada because he could afford neither New York nor Los Angeles. Vannucci, who had studied percussion to degree level, was a photographer at the Little Chapel Of Flowers, while Stoermer, who had unrealised dreams of becoming a lawyer or college professor or something academic, was a courier of boxers' urine samples for a local laboratory. I think we clicked, Stoermer says, because the three of us brought a certain wisdom to the band, the wisdom of experience, I guess, while Brandon brought the conviction that we really could go somewhere; the guy never faced rejection his whole life. Brandon Flowers is an intriguing combination of contradictions, much of it by design. After graduating from high school, the then 18-year-old worked in a succession of Las Vegas hotels as a bellhop, while dreaming of stardom. His first band, Blush Response, looked to the Pet Shop Boys for inspiration, but it was only when he met Keuning years later that he began to realise his full potential. Today, his desire to become the perfect 21st-century pop star is palpable, and so he is, as conviction dictates, moody, enigmatic and controversial. Initially wary of new people, he requires compliments before he feels able to administer trust, and so our first meeting is exquisitely uncomfortable. We convene at his favourite Mexican Restaurant, Chapalas, 20 minutes from downtown, but while the conversation between band members is free-flowing, Flowers is silent, smoking copiously while shooting me nervous looks. Often, for no particular reason, he will issue a fake, serpentine laugh â€” Ss-ss-ss â€” that comes cloaked in Boy George-strength irony. It is only after two full days in his company that he begins to mellow, and when we meet for dinner two evenings later, at",positive,,EN,,,3,UNKNOWN,119,33,0,0,0,33,0,N,,,34996,r/TheKillers,hawkyeager,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,10498,0,0,P00,,,P

Mostly because the people who don't understand pattern making usually get weeded out.

You'll want to spend the entire day in Ulla Johnson's lovely Los Angeles storeâ€”and that's the point. This Kelly Wearstlerâ€“Designed Boutique Is the Essence of California Dreamy This Kelly Wearstlerâ€“Designed Boutique Is the Essence of California Dreamy You'll want to spend the entire day in Ulla Johnson's lovely Los Angeles storeâ€”and that's the point. By Published: Nov 14, 2023 Save Article Ruffles, frills, flounces. It's all in the vocabulary of Ulla Johnson's romantic-with-an-edge garments, or lovelies, as they are often referred to on the Brooklyn-based fashion designer's website. Johnson has added yet another lovely to her line sheetâ€”a sun-drenched Los Angeles store designed by ELLE DECOR A-List Titan Kelly Wearstler. The boutique, located on Beverly Boulevard, is a uniquely Los Angeles wonderland, with a solarium, a lush garden terrace, and even a towering indoor Brachychiton tree. In typical Wearstlerian form, it's a place where succumbing to the fantasy is all too easy. But that's the aim: It truly feels like you could just spend the day there, the designer says. The introduction of a mezzanine provided an opportunity to install a double-height Brachychiton tree, which lends a Suessian twist to its elegant surroundings. We actually have it in our Malibu house, and it's just as magical, Wearstler adds. That's the beauty of California, bringing the outside in and vice versa. Adrian Gout Though Johnson and Wearstler feel like perfect creative partnersâ€”with their globetrotting sensibilities and innate senses of coolâ€”the pair's paths had never crossed. We have some mutual friends, but I had never met her in person, Wearstler says. She reached out about designing her L.A. flagship, and we had a great connection. The duo discovered a mutual love of artisans, travel, and art (Johnson's parents were archaeologists), and a project was born. And though the designer had two New York stores, one in Manhattan and one in Amagansett, she wanted this one to feel a little different, more residential, the designer says. Like, you want to hang out and be able to spend a few hours there. Step Inside Ulla Johnson's Los Angeles Store Open Gallery Wearstler wanted to nod to Johnson's aestheticâ€”which melds billowing silhouettes with batiks and block printsâ€”but filter it through a distinctly Angeleno lens. Ulla's clothing has a lot of texture and pattern. And so we wanted the space to also be about texture and color, Wearstler says. Our clients are our muse. First, Wearstler and her team needed to address the store's architecture. It was in an existing building that hadn't been touched in probably 20 years, explains Wearstler, whose firm is now beginning to tackle architectural scope. So we really opened it up. There's so much beautiful, natural light, and we wanted to make it a simple and architectural box. Additional skylights illuminate the second-floor lounge. A custom console table of Wearstler's own design displays a vintage Gianfranco Frattini lamp. The chair (left) is vintage from the 1980s. Adrian Gout With the architecture clarified, Wearstler and her team got to work crafting a retail paradise. The experience is built around the idea of entering a living room. Two sun-drenched, ground-floor salons feature comfy-looking sofas and armchairs (including a set designed by Italian modernist Carlos Scarpa) that practically beg worn-out shoppers to take a load off. The welcoming, light-washed roomsâ€”complete with twisting indoor trees, thick carpets, and featherlight racks of garmentsâ€”make it feel like you're entering a stylish friend's walk-in closet. You feel like you're in somebody's house, adds the designer. From there, shoppers can peruse handbags and jewelry in a suitably jewel-box-like chamber, which is clad entirely in speckled burl wood. A set of intriguing console tables, designed by Canadian artist Jeff Martin, is covered in peeling ceramic tiles that give the furnishings' surface the quality of unfurled ribbon and tree bark alike. Because texture and pattern is so integral to Ulla Johnson's fashions, Wearstler and her team incorporated those attributes into the boutique wherever possible. An intriguing jewelry case, designed by Canadian artist Jeff Martin, features peeling, grooved ceramic tiles that give the furnishing's surface the quality of ribbon and tree bark alike. Adrian Gaut By then they've collected some clothing, Wearstler observes, and shoppers can float up a narrow set of brass-detailed stairs to discover more lovelies or relax in a second-level lounge. All of the rooms have their own storytelling, the designer explains. When you walk into a store, you don't give it away all at one time. One of the store's most special spaces is a back terrace designed by New York landscape designer Miranda Brooks . Here, visitors can step onto the patio and catch some rays amid colossal pots planted with desert trees and shrubs. That's the beauty of California, Wearstler says, bringing the outside in and vice versa. There's certainly one happy customer. Johnson, on the eve of a celebratory dinner in the garden last month, posted a selfie from a fitting room: Surrounded by so much beauty. This store was built with endless love and care and decorated as I would my home.

This company has supported the State of Israel since 1966. DANONE - Group brands: Arvie, Badoit, Belin, BlÃ©dina, Phosphatine, Chipster, Evian, Galbani, Gervais, Heudebert, Lu, Taillefine, Volvic. Danone has just invested in the Golan, a Syrian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. NESTLÃ‰ - Group brands: Aquarel, Cheerios, Crunch, Frigor, Friskies, Galak, Golden Grahams, Kit Kat, Maggi, Mousline, NescafÃ©, RicorÃ©, Quality Street, Vittel, Perrier, Buitoni. The Swiss company owns 50.1% of the capital of the Israeli Osem food chain. The company has been accused since the 1950s of destroying the economy and health of the people of the third world, in particular with the imposition of its powdered milk for children in Africa, Asia and Latin America. INTEL - this large enterprise produces most of the PENTIUM 4 chips used by PC computers at its Kyriat Gat factory, located on the site of Iraq's Al-Manshiya, a Palestinian village razed to the ground after its eviction in 1949 by Egyptian soldiers . 2,000 inhabitants were driven from their land, despite a written pledge by the Zionists, monitored by the United Nations, not to touch the population. A campaign by their heirs to the USA in 2003 led INTEL to suspend a $2 billion investment project for an expansion of the Fab 18 factory in Kyriat Gat. L'OrÃ©al - Group brands: Biotherm Cacharel Giorgio Armani Parfums, LancÃ´me, Vichy, Roche-Posay, Garnier, Helena Rubinstein, Gemey-Maybelline, Jean-Louis David Shampooings, Le Club des crÃ©ateurs de beautÃ© (mail order sales of cosmetic products ), Redken 5th Avenue, Ralph Lauren perfumes, UshuaÃ¯a. L'OrÃ©al also invested millions creating a production unit in Migdal Haemeck, to the point that the American Jewish Congress expressed its satisfaction in seeing L'OrÃ©al becoming a warm friend of the State of Israel. ESTÃ‰E LAUDER - Group brands: Aramis, Clinique, La Mer, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger In addition to his investments, the director is the president of one of the most powerful Zionist organizations in the US, the Jewish National Fund. DELTA GALIL - this Israeli company specializes in the subcontracting of textile products, particularly underwear. Numerous underwear of foreign brands thus come directly from the factories of Delta Galil. This is the case of Marks & Spencers, Carrefour (Tex), Auchan, Gap, Hugo Boss, Playtex, Calvin Klein, Victoria's Secret, DKNY, Ralph Lauren. LEVI STRAUSS JEANS AND CELIO (depots specializing in men's clothing) These companies finance the new colonies in Palestine but also the schools of religious extremists around the world. TIMBERLAND (clothes, shoes, socks) - like his counterpart Ronald Lauder, Timberland President Jeffrey Swartz is an active member of the US Zionist lobby. He encouraged the US Jewish community to move to Israel but also sent Israeli soldiers to direct pro-Israeli propaganda in the US. DISNEYLAND - the Disney company has nothing idyllic about it and contributes, with its support to Israel, to sowing death in Palestine. It thus tacitly approves the illegal occupation of East Jerusalem by making Jerusalem the capital of Israel during an exhibition at the Epcot center in Florida, in violation of international UN resolutions. NOKIA - the Finnish telephony giant actively trades with the State of Israel. In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, the director of the group declared: that Israel was part of the company's priorities. A Nokia research center was thus born in Israel. MC DONALD'S - an emblematic enterprise of US cultural imperialism, the celebrated fast food restaurant chain provides significant support to the Israeli state. McDonald's has 80 restaurants in Israel and employs nearly 3,000 people there. He prohibits his staff from speaking Arabic. In the USA, the company appears among the partners of the Zionist organization Jewish Community based in Chicago. This organization works to maintain the military, economic and diplomatic aid provided by the USA to Israel. CATERPILLAR (construction equipment but also, clothes, shoes) - a broad campaign must be conducted to expose Caterpillar's criminal participation in the destruction of homes in Palestine with its giant bulldozers. It was with a Caterpillar that the Jewish American pacifist Rachel Corrie was killed by an Israeli soldier in 2003. The ACCORHOTEL hotel chain (Etap, Ibis, Mercure, Novotel, Sofitel) - this chain has many hotels in Israel, and recently, it opened a branch in the occupied Syrian territories, the Golan. The food chains present in the Israeli colonies: Domino Pizza hut Pizza Hut, HÃ¤agen Daaz, Burger King, Sigarette Morris ( Marlboro),Kimberly-Clarck (Kleenex, Kotex, Huggies), SanDisk (informatic), Toys RUS",positive,,EN,,,8,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,,1,smartnationitalia5s,user{user},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,P00,,,C

LoCI Controls Leads Industry Efforts on Landfill Methane Emissions Measurement with Real-Time Data Platform Development PR Newswire November 14, 2023 at 3:00 PM Â·2 min read Preliminary findings and next steps to be jointly presented with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency WAREHAM, Mass., Nov. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- LoCI Controls, Inc. , the leader in real-time data and control technology to increase methane capture and reduce emissions from landfills, today announced the development of its emissions measurement platform and preliminary findings. Snapshot of LoCI Controls' real-time methane emissions measurement platform and high-density mesh network The company's initial emissions measurement insights will be presented today in a joint session with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development, Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling (CEMM) and Center for Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response (CESER), held during the Air & Waste Management Association's Air Quality Measurement Methods and Technology Conference in Durham, North Carolina. ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement According to recent U.S. EPA research , municipal solid waste landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions from human activities in the United States. Historically, methane emissions from landfills have often been underestimated, underpinning the growing need to focus on accurate measurement. Story continues The latest addition to LoCI's real-time data and control system, the company's emissions measurement platform will capture emissions data continuously and at the same time as its gas collection system data, enabling landfill teams to act on the data faster and with greater precision â€” a true first in the landfill industry. This real-time information will offer landfills visibility into emission sources and hotspots, with data available from both temporal and spatial perspectives, to support proactive landfill gas collection operations. LoCI is uniquely positioned to leverage our core technical expertise to expand our system capabilities to include real-time emissions measurement. This development will support landfill operators, offering real-time data to enhance gas collection operations and align with landfill owners' emissions reduction and sustainability goals, said Peter Quigley, CEO and Chairman of LoCI Controls. About LoCI Controls LoCI Controls, Inc. is the leading real-time data and control company that increases methane capture and reduces emissions from landfills. Founded in 2013 by MIT graduates, the company combines on-site measurement and cloud-based software to increase landfill gas collection, while also offering on-site and remote operating support. LoCI's systems are installed on landfill projects across the United States and covered by 25 issued U.S. patents, with additional U.S. and international patents pending.

Continuing in Takahama's tradition, Kostadinov upholsters Naeko armchair with fabrics that pull inspiration from his future wife Deanna Fanning, and the patterns used in Deanna's, and her sister and design partner Laura's, graduate collection. Kostadinov's signature aesthetic is a perfect complement to the rigorous structures typical of Takahama's work. This is the wooden version of a project developed when Kazuhide Takahama was in Italy to set up the Japanese pavilion at XI Triennale in Milan, 1956/57. On that occasion he met Dino Gavina, with whom he began a life long collaboration and friendship. The first version of Naeko was produced in metal by Gavina spa, designed as a daily-bed thanks to its completely reclining backrest. It was immediately a great success, so that it was proposed also in a more valuable version in wood in 1958, exclusively as sofa with fixed backrest. In the same wooden version an armchair was also produced. Discover it at duplexdsgn.com â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ #paradisoterrestre #gavina #Kazuhidetakahama #collectibledesign #duplexdsgn .

AI modifies microbial genes to produce renewable fuels Targeted modification of microbial genome. (Source: Philip Gray/ORNL US Department of Energy) In a bid to improve the accuracy of current genome editing methods, ORNL scientists have generated excitement over the potential of their AI model to create sustainable fuels. 4 Reviews For over half a decade, the Centre for Bioenergy Innovation (CBI) has been tinkering with plant and microbial genes to address the ultimate challenge of a sustainable, bio-based economy. The CBI uses supercomputers, deep learning algorithms and gene editing tools such as CRISPR Cas9 to link genotype to phenotype. However, their research has been plagued by the incompatibility of existing gene-splicing models with microbial genomes. To improve the design of CRISPR Cas9 machinery, scientists at Oak Ridge National Library ( ORNL ) built an explainable AI model and trained it to identify the molecular cues that enable targeting of specific regions of a microbial genome. The new model, called an iterative random forest , has already been shown to optimize the cleavage and binding of DNA into E. Coli bacteria. Profound Implications Converging artificial intelligence and quantum biology in this way has profound implications for the work of the CBI. As the AI model improves, the researchers will be able to enhance processes like bacterial fermentation and feedstock mechanisms, thus contributing to the development of a sustainable bioeconomy. The project was funded jointly by the Department of Energy's Genomic Science Program, the CBI, the ORNL research program and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility.

This was a pre-owned home that had sat vacant for 5 years, and will be only a winter home for us. We just replaced our water heater and my plumber recommended this Evolution hybrid softener/carbon filter/KDF. It comes in either 1.0 cubic feet of resin or 1.5 cubic feet. There is a reverse osmosis unit under the sink that would require servicing and replacing all the cartridge's. The plumber says I wouldn't need the RO system with this type of hybrid softener. I've not heard of this type of combination. Are these good units or should I go with an old school 'tried and true' softener? EDIT: for some reason this won't let me post a picture of the unit. The resin tank is on the floor with the attached carbon filter tank above that, with the clock unit on top of the carbon filter. It looks like a 3 stage rocket.

Investors will listen for any signs that the retailer's sales are turning around or gaining momentum as Target gets ready for the crucial holiday season. In this article Follow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNT A Target department store in North Miami Beach, Florida, on May 17, 2023. Joe Raedle | Getty Images Target will report fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, as the company tries to claw its way back from a string of disappointing results and high-profile setbacks . Investors will listen for any signs that the retailer's sales are turning around as Target gets ready for the crucial holiday season. Here's what Wall Street expects for the company for the three-month period, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Earnings per share: $1.48 expected Revenue: $25.24 billion expected Sales have slowed across the retail industry as consumers feel pain from elevated prices and choose to spend on experiences instead. Yet Target, which sells a heavier mix of clothing, home goods and impulse purchases than some rivals, has been particularly squeezed. Plus, it has faced its own challenges. Target got blowback for a collection of merchandise for Pride month, a celebration of LGBTQ+ people and issues, that it has sold for more than a decade. It got hit by higher levels of organized retail crime . And it recently shuttered nine stores in major cities, blaming the closures on theft and threats of violence. The Minneapolis-based company cut its full-year forecast in August, saying it expects comparable sales to decline by about a mid-single-digit percentage and earnings per share to range from $7 to $8. Target's stock has suffered as sales stagnate. Shares of the company have fallen nearly 26% this year, with their value cut by more than half since the highs of the Covid pandemic. watch now ",positive,,EN,,,"1,09",UNITED STATES,19088,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107257023-1686775871826-gettyimages-1491042036-dsc03042_gayitpjr.jpeg?v=1699979792&amp;w=1920&amp;h=1080,143512769,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,43053830,0,0,P00,,,P

My Kindle. I think I paid about â‚¬100 for it a couple of years ago, but it has lasted so well. Anywhere I go it's in the bag with me, I love to read and I think having something so small and simple to carry around makes it easier. What ways did you prefer to shop during the Covid-19 restrictions â€“ online or local? We tried to buy Irish as much as possible, as Covid made business so challenging, particularly for small, local Irish businesses. In general, I prefer to shop online now and Covid probably made that a bit easier as so many businesses moved to an online model. Do you haggle over prices? No, I generally let Shane, my husband, do that as he takes such pride in haggling. The joy he takes from getting a bargain is a sight to behold and I wouldn't want to get in the way of that. How did the Covid-19 crisis change your spending habits, and was there something in particular that you either stopped buying or started buying, as a result? I have probably bought more online since the pandemic. Generally, I think we're all just spending more time online. Our whole way of working has shifted to a more flexible model, so by virtue of being online remotely, I'm probably just spending more time doing other jobs online, too. Do you invest in shares? Not really. Our investments are more bricks and mortar based, but it's something we keep an open mind on. Cash or card? Card. Although in saying that, I rarely carry a card as I generally pay for everything on my phone. What was the last thing you bought and was it good value for money? I just bought a customised weekly planner whiteboard for the wall in the kitchen and it is a game changer. We needed it to keep track of all the activities, and so on, and it is absolutely value for money. And time! Have you ever successfully saved up for a relatively big purchase? Buying a house and renovating it recently definitely focused the mind to save for a bigger purpose. Both were done through a combination of savings and a mortgage. Cars are the other thing I would generally have bought from savings. Have you ever lost money? Yeah, but nothing worth talking about here, to be honest. Are you a gambler and if so have you ever had a big win? No, I don't really gamble. I might have the odd bet on Cheltenham or if I was at the races with friends, but I spend my life playing, working and talking about sport, so I don't need the added layer of betting on it, too. Is money important to you? It would be foolish to say it's not important because it's so central to how you live your life and the freedom it gives you. So yes, it's hugely important, but it's never been the overriding factor in my decision making. How much money do you have on you now? None. I rarely carry cash anyway, but whatever I had was fleeced this morning by the kids for their school sports fundraiser.

Tutto su Elle Decor Una delle sedie piÃ¹ iconiche del â€˜900: la storia e le caratteristiche della Wassily Chiari di Marcel Bauer. Tutto su Elle Decor Â© Knoll La scuola d'arte e di design Bauhaus rappresentÃ² un cruciale punto di riferimento nel mondo del design dalla sua apertura a Weimar nel 1919 fino alla chiusura, forzata dal partito nazista, nel 1933. Non Ã¨ un caso, dunque, che uno degli oggetti d'arredamento piÃ¹ iconici dell'ultimo secolo provenga proprio dalla mente di uno degli insegnanti di punta dell'accademia d'arte: Marcel Breuer. Quest'ultimo teneva infatti i corsi di falegnameria e della lavorazione dei metalli quando, tra il 1925 ed il 1926, ideÃ² la Model B3 Chair che, successivamente, divenne celebre con il nome di Wassily Chair. Dopo gli anni come studente e la promozione ad insegnante, Marcel Breuer realizzÃ² cosÃ¬ una sedia in grado di incarnare perfettamente gli ideali della scuola fondata da Walter Gropius, ovvero la conciliazione, la sovrapposizione tra gli oggetti d'arte ed i prodotti industriali. Marcel Bauer e il Bauhaus Marcel Breuer nasce nel 1902 in Ungheria, a Pecs, una cittÃ  a pochi chilometri dal confine croato. GiÃ  da adolescente il suo avvenire sembra introiettato verso una prodigiosa carriera nel mondo del design e dell'architettura: dopo gli studi a Vienna , neanche ventenne riesce ad entrare nella prestigiosa accademia Bauhaus e nello stesso anno progetta la African Chair, uno dei suoi primi lavori degni di nota. Dopo un periodo passato in uno studio di architettura parigino, Bauer torna, come detto, alla Bauhaus in qualitÃ  di insegnante: le sue lezioni diventano una delle punte di diamante dell'intera accademia. In quegli anni le sue sperimentazioni su materiali come legno, ferro ed il modernissimo eisengarn portarono alla creazione di innovativi oggetti di arredamento, su tutti, come detto, la Wassily Chair. Nel 1928 Bauer lascia definitivamente la Bauhaus dopo le dimissioni del fondatore Walter Gropius. Negli anni seguenti Bauer si dedicherÃ  specialmente all'architettura, progettando edifici e palazzi in giro per il mondo. Getty Images Wassily Chair: materiali, design e caratteristiche La Wassily Chair rimane, in ogni caso, di gran lunga l'opera piÃ¹ celebre dell'artista ungherese. La sua realizzazione deriva, tuttavia, da un gesto quotidiano che probabilmente ognuno di noi avrÃ  compiuto una volta nella vita: l'acquisto di una bicicletta. Dopo aver comperato il celebre veicolo a due ruote, Bauer fu profondamente colpito dalla sua leggerezza e resistenza e decise di impiegare anch'egli, per i suoi progetti, un acciaio tubolare simile a quello che costituiva le biciclette dell'epoca. Ne scaturÃ¬ un oggetto rivoluzionario nel mondo del design: una sedia formata dall'intrecciarsi di diversi tubolari d'acciaio, una vera e propria opera d'arte da applicare all'industria dell'arredamento. Il materiale piÃ¹ innovativo utilizzato per la Wassily Chair, tuttavia, non fu l'acciaio, bensÃ¬ l'eisengarn. Materiale formato da un'intessitura di cotone trattato con cera, paraffina e successivamente calandrato per dargli un'ottima resistenza, l'eisengarn fu inventato nel XIX secolo e dimenticato dal mondo industriale, finchÃ©, durante le lezioni di Bauer, una sua studentessa, Margaretha Reichardt, sperimentÃ² e migliorÃ² la qualitÃ  del filo e sviluppÃ² un tessuto e un materiale per le cinghie da utilizzare sulle sedie in acciaio tubolare di Breuer. Nel corso degli anni '20, seguendo i dettami della Bauhaus, la sedia venne prodotta e venduta in serie ed ottenne un grande successo. Il primo produttore della Wassily Chair fu l'industria austriaca Thonet, che la commercializzÃ² con il nome di Model B3. courtesy Knoll, photo Santi Caleca L'origine del nome ed il revival degli anni â€˜60 La seconda metÃ  degli anni '50 fu un periodo particolarmente importante per la carriera di Marcel Breuer: dopo anni di lavoro per progetti di interni, di dimensioni relativamente ridotte, in quegli anni l'artista ungherese cominciÃ² a firmare i disegni per palazzi e costruzioni di grande portata. All'inizio degli anni '60 Bauer, dunque, Ã¨ un affermato architetto che vive negli Stati Uniti: proprio in quel periodo, durante un soggiorno a New York , Bauer conobbe Dino Gravina, celebre imprenditore italiano del settore d'arredamento e design. Quella tra Gravina e l'architetto ungherese fu un fruttuoso incontro: l'imprenditore italiano riuscÃ¬ a convincere Bauer a rimettere la sedia Model B3 sul mercato. Il nome Model B3, tuttavia, non piacque all'imprenditore, che lo considerava troppo freddo. Serviva un nuovo nome capace di catturare immediatamente l'attenzione del nuovo pubblico di consumatori. La geniale idea venne in mente a Gravina dopo aver ascoltato un racconto di Bauer: quest'ultimo, infatti, narrÃ² all'imprenditore di come il celebre pittore astrattista Wassily Kandinskij apprezzÃ² cosÃ¬ tanto la sedia in tubolari d'acciaio ed eisengarn che volle a tutti i costi il primo esemplare per il suo studio. Nacque cosÃ¬ il nome Wassily Chair, in onore del primo grande apprezzatore dei piÃ¹ rivoluzionari arredi della storia del design: nel 1962 fu cosÃ¬ lanciato per la seconda volta sul mercato il prodotto che, spinto dal piÃ¹ accattivante nomenclatura di Gravina, ottenne uno strepitoso successo. L'affiliazione di Gravina alla produzione della Wassily Chair, tuttavia, durÃ² poco: nel 1968 la sua azienda venne rilevata dal colosso statunitense della Knoll, che si aggiudicÃ² i diritti di realizzazione della sedia, che ancora oggi viene prodotta sotto il marchio americano.

Post by Elena Schiavon Come indossare il bomber leggero da mezza stagione Tra trench, giacche di jeans, blazer e chiodi di pelle la lista dei capispalla leggeri che si possono sfruttare durante le mezze stagioni diventa ogni anno sempre piÃ¹ lunga. Foto Pinterest Ci sono giacche evergreen, versatili e facili da portare, pezzi piÃ¹ modaioli, che richiedono un maggior impegno per essere abbinati come si deve, ma noi, nella maggior parte dei casi, quando siamo chiamate a fare una scelta, tendiamo sempre per propendere per le prime. Foto Pinterest Il bomber , il capo chiave degli anni '90 rientra sicuramente nella categoria dei capispalla piÃ¹ difficili da indossare. Ma dal momento che ha fatto ritorno in tutte le collezioni delle ultime stagioni, vale la pena fare un secondo tentativo e provare a reinserirlo nel nostro guardaroba. Il bomber Ã¨ tornato alla ribalta e ha conquistato le fashion addicted di mezzo mondo, ed Ã¨ stato al centro dell'attenzione grazie a modelle e trend setter che hanno cominciato a indossarlo in ogni occasione. Foto Pinterest Ma per noi ragazze comuni, che non posiamo quotidianamente davanti all'obiettivo dei fotografi e che il piÃ¹ delle volte ci teniamo a indossare look non troppo sopra le righe, non Ã¨ sempre tutto cosÃ¬ semplice, e il bomber in effetti puÃ² risultare difficile da abbinare. Per chi Ã¨ tentata dall'idea di acquistarlo ma teme di non essere in grado di abbinarlo per bene, le foto di street style che si trovano sui social possono essere un'ottima fonte di ispirazione. Guardarle con occhio critico puÃ² essere un buon modo per rompere il ghiaccio e cominciare a indossare il bomber con nonchalance. Bomber: idee look per il giorno Con i jeans, un grande classico basic Con jeans baggy ( foto Pinterest ) e skinny Per il giorno, le versioni piÃ¹ gettonate sono quelle a tinta unita, in nero, rosa e verde, da abbinare anche solo a un paio di jeans. Potete provare il bomber anche con le sneakers, ma fate attenzione perchÃ© il risultato potrebbe essere troppo casual quindi Ã¨ bene valutare in quale contesto si va ad indossare. Con pantaloni culotte neri, per un look total black Per mantenere un basso profilo, provate ad abbinare un paio di pantaloni culotte neri a un bomber dello stesso colore e completate il tutto con dei mocassini neri laccati e una maglia bianca. Con elementi eleganti e t-shirt o camicia bianca Bomber con outfit elegante (foto Pinterest ) â€“ Bomber con t-shirt bianca (foto Pinterest ) Partire da un look black&white puÃ² essere il miglior modo per prendere confidenza con questo capospalla. Foto Pinterest Se volete indossare questi due capi insieme, prediligete dei pantaloni eleganti (o dei pantaloni beige oversize) e abbinateli a una camicia bianca o a un pullover con dettagli che si fanno notare: solo cosÃ¬ scongiurerete l'effetto look da palestra. Bomber + vestito Foto Pinterest â€“ Foto Pinterest Chi ama i look piÃ¹ eccentrici, puÃ² provare ad indossare un bomber oversize con un vestito lungo stampato o con le frange . Oppure optate per un bomber verde, da indossare con gonna sopra i pantaloni o addirittura con la doppia gonna come nella foto. L'idea di styling in piÃ¹ Il tocco in piÃ¹? Fate scivolare il bomber in modo da mostrare le spalle, proprio come se fosse un top off the shoulder : le IT girl lo fanno di continuo! Bomber: idee look per la sera Diversi anche gli abbinamenti da provare di sera. Con i pantaloni palazzo Foto Pinterest Per un look piuttosto discreto, abbinate il vostro bomber a un paio di pantaloni palazzo, una t-shirt con applicazioni preziose e un paio di dÃ©colletÃ©. Chi invece vuole ottenere un look che coniughi tutti gli elementi piÃ¹ di moda, puÃ² abbinare il suo outfit ad un paio di pantaloni cargo e tacchi altissimi. Il bomber ricamato Oppure optate per un bomber con ricami femminili da indossare con un paio di pantaloni neri, dolcevita e una borsa a mano.

E' finalmente disponibile la collezione di Rabanne per H&M: scopri i prezzi, i pezzi iconici e il confronto con i pezzi originali dell'iconico marchio francese! Finalmente Ã¨ disponibile online e in alcuni store selezionato la tanto attesa collezione di Rabanne per H&M . Una collaborazione che si inserisce nel solco delle ormai innumerevoli collaborazioni tra il colosso di fast fashion svedese e i piÃ¹ famosi designer del mondo della moda. Il marchio H&M ha collaborato con Rabanne, famoso per le sue creazioni audaci e innovative, per creare una collezione unica, che incarna la perfetta fusione tra moda e arte. La collezione si ispira alle tendenze degli anni '90 , ma con un tocco moderno ed eccentrico. I capi sono caratterizzati da materiali lucidi, silhouette audaci e strutturate come Ã¨ nel DNA di Rabanne. Quindi, se sei alla ricerca di nuove idee per il tuo guardaroba e desideri vestire i tuoi outfit con un tocco di eleganza e stile, non perdere l'occasione di scoprire la nuova collezione H&M Rabanne: vediamola nel dettaglio. Per prima cosa ad una prima occhiata in generale i prezzi sono ben diversi da quelli a cui siamo abituati per prodotti di fast fashion. PACO RABANNE â€“ Borsa a spalla in materiale sintetico metallizzato con paillettes Sparkle Nano Dall'altro lato, va detto che rispetto ai pezzi degli originali Rabanne, il prezzo Ã¨ decisamente piÃ¹ competitivo, pur trattandosi di una sorta di riedizione dei suoi grandi classici, come la famosa borsa a dischetti di paillettes. Nella versione iconica firmata dal brand costa circa 700 â‚¬, mentre la proposta di Rabanne per H&M si attesta attorno ai 200 â‚¬. Cosa troviamo in questa collezione? Troviamo sia pezzi per la donna che per l'uomo. Il catalogo Ã¨ davvero molto ricco. Vediamo alcuni dei pezzi piÃ¹ interessanti. Dove comprare la collezione Rabanne x H&M La collezione Ã¨ disponibile online sul sito H&M e in Italia due negozi fisici selezionati: lo store H&M di Milano Piazza Duomo e quello di Roma in Via del Corso. Nei negozi gli acquisti sono limitati ad uno per modello, per consentire la disponibilitÃ  dei prodotti al maggior numero possibile di persone. La stessa cosa vale per gli acquisti online. La collezione di Rabanne per H&M: le proposte con gli iconici dischi Il minidress con pailletts a dischi Miniabito realizzato con dischi di paillettes interconnesse distintive del designer. Le paillettes dorate sono realizzate in ottone, mentre quelle argento in materiale plastico. Abito lungo a sirena Abito lungo dal mood da discoteca in jersey elasticizzato interamente rivestito di paillettes luccicanti per un look da far rimanere a bocca aperta. La gonna lunga da WOW Un altro pezzo iconico della collezione di Rabanne per H&M Ã¨ questa gonna lunga dal mood da discoteca , realizzata in jersey elasticizzato interamente rivestito di paillettes luccicanti. La mini bag con dischi di paillettes Abbiamo visto prima la borsa piccola a doppio strato in pelle con paillettes e dischi di metallo interconnessi di diverse tonalitÃ  e dimensioni: un altro dei prodotti iconici riproposti da Rabanne per H&M. La collezione di Rabanne per H&M: le proposte in mesh Un'altra categoria di prodotti interessanti, oltre a quelli realizzati con i dischetti di paillettes, Ã¨ quella dei prodotti realizzata in mesh, iconico materiale di metallo molto utilizzato dal designer.

Qui trovi i nostri consigli per creare degli outfit da capogiro con le tue New Balance! Crea outfit super cool con gli ultimi modelli di New Balance! Qui trovi i nostri consigli per creare degli outfit da capogiro con le tue New Balance! Post by Elena Schiavon Tra le scarpe piÃ¹ amate e indossate di sempre ci sono le New Balance: ecco come indossarle non solo per lo sport Grande classico del mondo delle scarpe sportive, le New Balance â€“ di cui tutti abbiamo in mente il classico modello 574â€“ sono scarpe che si prestano a molteplici abbinamenti e occasioni. Comode, comodissime, grazie alla suola leggermente alta e imbottita, possono essere considerate delle chunky sneakers classiche, che tornano e ritornano negli scatti di streetstyle proprio per il loro essere essere ormai dei classici intramontabili. Va detto che ormai, le New Balance non vengono quasi piÃ¹ usate per look prettamente sportivi, ma per aggiungere un tocco di coolness anche agli outfit piÃ¹ basici. Come abbinare le New Balance: 5 idee outfit Ma oltre che con outfit sportivi, come possiamo indossare le New Balance per ottenere dei look originali e contemporanei? Vediamo 5 idee outfit con le New Balance! Outfit #1: New Balance con blazer maschile Foto Pinterest Se state cercando di individuare un look da mezza stagione che sia di assoluta tendenza, eccolo qui. New Balance, jeans mom, blazer con spalle oversize (magari in un color beige o sabbia) e maglietta o canottiera bianca. Da portare con una borsa dalle linee essenziali come la Prada re-edition 2005. Et voilÃ , il look da fashion victim Ã¨ servito! Outfit #2: New Balance con giacca workwear Foto Pinterest La giacca workwear, oppure dritta, lunga e ampia, portata con un paio di jeans in stile mom o bootcut, e le New Balance, magari in un modello colorato o piÃ¹ nuovo, come il modello 990 (a destra). Questo Ã¨ un look fintamente casuale che piacerÃ  a chi cerca l'originalitÃ  anche nel look piÃ¹ basico. Outfit #3: New Balance e look da ufficio anni 80 Foto Pinterest Questo Ã¨ il look che personalmente preferisco in questo momento: pantaloni abbastanza formali da ufficio, maglietta o camicia morbida basica, e New Balance ai piedi che possono essere poi cambiate all'occorrenza. Praticissimo e super basic, per chi non vuole osare troppo o non vuole stare troppo a pensare a che cosa indossare, soprattutto la mattina. Outfit #4: New Balance con la gonna Foto Pinterest Negli ultimi anni sono state totalmente sdoganate anche le sneakers con le gonne, o, meglio, con abiti da sera o gonne e look dai tessuti importanti e preziosi. Non tutti amano questo abbinamento, ma Ã¨ davvero comodo se dovete muovervi velocemente in cittÃ  e avete un appuntamento elegante o formale (per cui potrete cambiare le scarpe una volta arrivata a destinazione). Outfit #5: New Balance e total black Foto Pinterest Infine, per le amanti del total black come noi, un rassicurante outfit tutto nero. Potete abbinare le New Balance ad un paio di pantaloni dritti oppure in stile tuta ginnica, con il polsino, ma qui dovete valutare quello che piace a voi e vi fa sentire a vostro agio. I modelli di New Balance piÃ¹ di moda Oltre alle classiche 574, quelle che abbiamo imparato a conoscere negli anni, nelle ultime stagioni sono emersi come tendenze altri due modelli di New Balance: le 530 e le 550. Vediamo nel dettaglio alcune idee outfit con questi tre modelli di New Balance! Outfit con le New Balance 574 Foto Pinterest Il modello 574 Ã¨ quello di New Balance forse piÃ¹ conosciuto. Un design ibrido da strada/trail realizzato su una pianta piÃ¹ ampia rispetto alle silhouette da corsa della generazione precedente di sneakers. Le 574 sono un mix versatile di nuove, diverse, semplici, robuste, durevoli e comode sneaker, diventate un capo irrinunciabile del guardaroba in tutto il globo.

Danza classica e contemporanea Danza classica e contemporanea Home Mosaic dance fest, successo a Dubai | Danza classica e contemporanea Mosaic dance fest, successo a Dubai Danza classica e contemporanea 15 Novembre 2023 Di seguito un comunicato diffuso dagli organizzatori: Due giorni pieni di Arte, Danza, Musica e meeting per programmare quello che si annuncia essere uno dei piÃ¹ grandi Festival dedicati alla Danza Classica e Contemporanea. Dubai in due giorni Ã¨ entrata in osmosi con il mondo del balletto; i migliori ballerini provenienti da tutto il mondo si sono dati appuntamento per confrontarsi tra loro e creare il concept del Mosaic Dance Fest. Il tutto si Ã¨ svolto al Belcanto del Dubai Opera, dove le scenografie e le coreografie curate dal Team di Georgi Gotsiridze hanno suggellato la qualitÃ  della manifestazione. Il Mosaic Dance Fest nasce da un'idea di Valery Kapeikin, che ha voluto un Team d'eccezione a dirigere il Festival: Nicola Convertino, Victor Logai, Georgi Gotsiridze e Konstantin Panfilov, la mission del Festival Ã¨ quella di creare un palcoscenico per le nuove generazioni e nel contempo assegnare degli Awards ai Big della Danza mondiale. In attesa della prossima edizione, che si terrÃ  a Dubai a Novembre.2024, il Comitato organizzatore del Mosaic lavorerÃ  alacremente per rendere il Festival importante, autorevole e ricco di innovazioni. Le contaminazioni saranno la parte integrante di questo progetto e tutti i ballerini che hanno partecipato in questa prima edizione saranno uniti per trasformare il progetto da theoretical theory ad un progetto finito e realizzabile. E' doveroso a questo punto citare i principali attori che sono stati coinvolti in questa prima edizione dell'8 e 9.Novembre: Dal Giappone Arisa Hashimoto Prima ballerina del teatro nazionale di Kyoto. Dal resto del mondo molte stelle del balletto: Dal Brasile Alfredo Ligabue, da Mosca la grande Anna Tikhomirova prima ballerina del teatro Bolshoi, Reece Clarke (Royal Ballet), Daria Pavlenko (Mariinsky Theater), Jason Kittelberger (Choreographer), Joseph Kudra (Theatre Rambert London), Dall'Inghilterra l'Orchestra Birmingham Royal Ballet, Alexander Trush (Hamburg Ballet), Alice Renavand (Paris Opera), Anna Osadcenko (Stuttgart Ballet), Oleg Ivenko (Munich State Ballet), Jason Reilly (Stuttgart Ballet), Lyudmila Konovalova (Vienna State Ballet), Madoka Sugai (Hamburg Ballet), Ksenia Shevtsova (Munich State Ballet), Yasmin Nagdi (Royal Ballet), Yonah Acosta (The Bavarian State Ballet), Alejandro Virelles (Berlin State Ballet), Florian Magnenet (Paris Opera). Dall'Italia gli ambasciatori della danza sono molteplici: Raffaele Paganini e Kledi Kadiu hanno aderito all'iniziativa, a rappresentare la moda vediamo Federica Balestra figlia del grande Renato Balestra che ha vestito alcune modelle presenti all'evento, poi Tonino Lamborghini uno dei partner del Festival che ha vestito tutto il personale e alcune modelle presenti, AirDP di Alessandro del Piero, altro partner importante con la sua linea di occhiali sempre all'avanguardia, DJ Aniceto, il DJ di Piero Chiambretti faceva parte del parterre e protagonista nel cocktail di benvenuto sulla nave la mattina dell'8, allietando i Vip e gli artisti presenti, Alessandro Safina si Ã¨ esibito alla serata di Gala tenutasi al Ristorante Belcanto e la conduzione Ã¨ stata affidata all'attrice ed ex Miss Italia Denny Mendez per dare un pizzico di brio alla manifestazione. Da Roma la troupe di Fashion Tv, attraverso la Collaborazione con la CR Movie Production rappresentata dal suo amministratore Patrizia Ceruleo e la regia di Giuseppe Racioppi, ha ripreso le parti salienti della manifestazione che metterÃ  in differita, con la Regia Giuseppe Racioppi rappresenta anche RAI World, la cui messa in onda Ã¨ prevista anch'essa in differita. Racioppi seguirÃ  anche la realizzazione di un programma televisivo in 2 puntate che sarÃ  messo in onda in differita in 30 paesi nel mondo e in 150 tv private e 200 radio private in Italia. Dalla Cina abbiamo una rappresentanza di Tik Tok Cina, chiamato Douyin, con la presenza del responsabile Youghua Hu e Francesca Ferrini, nota influencer italiana ma popolare in Cina; Tik Tok metterÃ  in onda diversi video delle parti essenziali della manifestazione cogliendo anche i gossip e il backstage del Festival. Sempre dalla Cina ci sarÃ  Tang Chaowei della rivista Dreams e Harper's Bazaar China. Dal Cile la Tv Nazionale cilena riprenderÃ  tutto l'evento con la presenza della produttrice Ximena Ravani e la star della danza cilena Juan Carlos Melendez.

The ends of the bananas have dog heads, which all look different depending on the person seeing it, and all the bananas have the classic Devil Fruit swirls around them. **Abilities:** The user gains the ability to go into a half-cerberus and full-cerberus form. For those who don't know, a Cerberus is a 3-headed dog from mythology that would usually be guarding the underworld or somewhere similar. **Half-Cerberus Form:** The user grows about 1/3 of their size and grows 2 more heads, those being that of a dog. These can breath out fire, ice, and lightning respectively. They gain a tail and dog-like claws and paws. The user's head also turns into a dog head. **Full Cerberus:** The user turns into a cerberus. That's mainly it. Their clothes are kept, but that's about it otherwise. **Awakening:** The user is able to assimilate 2 other beings into their body while transforming to Half-Cerberus or Full Cerberus form, but cannot assimilate them while already transformed or transforming to human form, kicking them out as soon as they enter human form. The beings can escape being assimilated, however, so this is of course best used with 2 willing participants. The user, after assimilating the selected beings, can use any Devil Fruit powers, attacks, or Haki abilities that the absorbed beings can use until they are kicked out.",positive,,EN,,,3,UNKNOWN,61,1,0,0,0,1,0,N,,,15220,r/DevilFruitIdeas,Video_Game_Fann,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,4566,0,0,P00,,,P

RTÃ‰ is preparing to axe 400 jobs as part of the director general's plan to save the national broadcaster before it runs out of cash in a matter of months. Aisling Moloney 14/11/2023 RTÃ‰ is preparing to axe 400 jobs as part of the director general's plan to save the national broadcaster before it runs out of cash in a matter of months. Kevin Bakhurst â€˜s strategic outline, being unveiled to staff on Tuesday, will contain a â€˜headcount reduction' of 20% of its 1,800 staff between now and 2028 at a cost of â‚¬40million, sources confirmed. Today's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW But ahead of the meeting, tensions are rising between staff and management over the leaking of the plan on Monday night, with morale already at an all-time low. The reduction of 400 jobs will begin with 40 immediate voluntary redundancies. This will be financed by cash reserves in RTÃ‰ from the sale of land in 2017. Advertisement RTÃ‰ is preparing to axe 400 jobs as part of the director general's plan to save the national broadcaster before it runs out of cash in a matter of months. Pic: Leah Farrell/RollingNews.ie There are fears that mid-range earners at RTÃ‰ will be hardest hit but Mr Bakhurst has also pledged to target people on large salaries, reducing the number of people on over â‚¬100,000 a year. Payment for all of staff accounts for 51% of RTÃ‰'s costs, and its top 100 earners range from salaries of over â‚¬500,000 to â‚¬108,000. It's understood that the director general's plan includes a target of â‚¬10million savings across 2024, outside of staff cuts. Also included in the plan are: The possible closure of RTÃ‰ channels, such as RTÃ‰ One +1 and RTÃ‰2 +1, and of digital radio stations RTÃ‰ Radio 1 Extra, RTÃ‰ Junior Radio, RTÃ‰ Pulse and RTÃ‰ 2XM; The sale of land on the Donnybrook campus, but not a wholesale move out of Dublin 4; A commitment to move towards a â€˜more hybrid production model' with less production of programming in-house, leading to fears about the production of Fair City, which is currently made directly by the station; Reviving the regional studios of Cork, Limerick and Galway, with a targeted increase of production in those locations by 2025. RTÃ‰ Cork is already the home of Nationwide and the Today show, and after a visit to the studio earlier this year, Mr Bakhurst remarked to staff that he was amazed by what they were producing there with much fewer resources and dilapidated offices and studios. Staff on Monday night said the â€˜mood is awful' in RTÃ‰. However, Mr Bakhurst is hoping to impress both staff and the Government with his plan, and is looking for a â‚¬40million bailout for RTÃ‰ to stay afloat, with funds expected to run out in â€˜early spring', according to the director general. Kevin Bakhurst's strategic outline, being unveiled to staff on Tuesday, will contain a â€˜headcount reduction' of 20% of its 1,800 staff between now and 2028 at a cost of â‚¬40million Pic: Tom Honan Ahead of the meeting with RTÃ‰ staff on Monday from 3.30pm, which is scheduled for 90 minutes, Mr Bakhurst wrote in an email: â€˜This meeting will give me an opportunity to take you through our vision for the future and answer your questions before we share the document more widely. Advertisement â€˜I, along with my colleagues on the Interim Leadership Team, will also be available to discuss our vision for RTÃ‰ with you over the coming days and weeks and you will have an opportunity to share your views.' Government ministers have long rejected the suggestion of redundancies at RTÃ‰, even after the revelations that have unfolded since the saga surrounding secret payments to Ryan Tubridy decimated its coffers and reputation. Extra's sister publication, the Irish Mail on Sunday revealed in July that 400 job losses were forecast, though this was rebuffed the next day by Green Party minister Ossian Smyth, on behalf of Media Minister Catherine Martin, his party colleague. He said there was â€˜no truth' to the reports. The branch of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) representing RTÃ‰ staff said on Monday night it was â€˜dismaying' to hear about the job losses through a leak to the media, and called on RTÃ‰ to immediately issue the plan to all staff. Tensions are rising between staff and management over the leaking of the plan on Monday night, with morale already at an all-time low. Pic: Gareth Chaney/Collins Photos The NUJ said the leak was a â€˜further blow to the trust of staff in an organisation where morale is at an all-time low'. It's understood the plan does not contain any reference to cutting specific programmes or shows; however, SÃ©amus Dooley, general secretary of the NUJ, said that 400 redundancies will impact on programming. He remarked: â€˜When you take out 400 people, are you going to take out the work of 400 people? I know some of the work can be outsourced, there are RTÃ‰ vacancies that have not been filled: the Dublin Correspondent is one in the newsroom. â€˜We are gravely concerned at the scale of the proposed redundancies and will require detailed information on how it is proposed to maintain core services and the impact on staff of such drastic proposals.' Mr Dooley also said staff will be â€˜very sceptical' about a new voluntary redundancy programme as RTÃ‰ is currently engaging in an external review of the last two voluntary exit programmes. Kevin Bakhurst is hoping to impress both staff and the Government with his plan. Pic: Fran Veale He said many staff will welcome the salaries of those on over â‚¬100,000 being reduced. â€˜That can start at the level of senior executives in the organisation,' said Mr Dooley. â€˜If we are to have an informed discussion on salaries in RTÃ‰ we need complete transparency about executives' pay.' Mr Bakhurst has said he will reveal executives' pay in the annual report due to be released in a year's time. However, Mr Dooley called on him to reveal this now, saying: â€˜We cannot negotiate in a vacuum. All the information needs to be on the table.' RTÃ‰ on Monday night said that Mr Bakhurst had no comment to make, and would be meeting unions and staff representatives this morning before he holds a briefing for all staff. Early indications from Government sources said the plan will be subject to a â€˜very high level of scrutiny' before a â‚¬40million bailout is granted. â€˜The report will be parsed in detail about whether it meets expectations regarding the future viability of RTÃ‰,' said a source. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday said that the exact amount of the bailout to be granted is â€˜yet to be agreed'.

Golf influencer Paige Spiranac is taking potshots from some who think she crossed the line to porn in a recent Instagram photo. Golf Influencer Paige Spiranac Takes Heat for Hot Shot of Barely-There Skirt: â€˜I'm Stunned' Instagram Warner Todd Huston 14 Nov 2023 Golf influencer Paige Spiranac is taking potshots from some who think she crossed the line after posting a photo of herself standing on the green wearing a skirt that seems inadequate to cover her rear end and featuring a suggestive caption. Spiranac, who has become a leading Instagram presenter with nearly four million followers, regularly posts racy images of cropped tops showing off her ample attributes, tight pants, shorts, and other revealing outfits. But many feel she simply went too far with her post from Friday. In the glamour shot, she wears a skin-tight white top that bares her midriff and a skirt that reveals some of her backside. She stands with a raised leg and holds the flagstick on a putting green. She captioned the image, Do you like to leave the pin in or pull out? A post shared by Paige Spiranac (@_paige.renee) Some fans in the comments criticized the model for being a bit too daring. Spiranac took to her X account to respond to the critics, saying she considers the photo quite tame. It's amazing the outrage this outfit is causing on Instagram. It's just a little cheeky or booty cleavage, as I like to say lol. I think it's quite tame, and this picture is cute. Thoughts? she posted.

As the launch of ChatGPT supercharged conversations about innovation, the company created a policy for testing and using artificial intelligence. It's designed to help employees understand the limits of what they can do and what the company leaders' expectations are for them to learn and adopt new technology. Our employees are looking for guardrails, said Pete Weir, Discovery Education's chief product officer. Our employees want to understand: Is the expectation that I'm using every single technology that's coming out there because I need to stay at the forefront of it? Business Insider spoke with Weir about the company's use of generative AI to minimize mundane tasks and improve productivity, as well as guardrails to help employees explore and innovate without taking on AI projects beyond the company's scope. Advertisement The following Q&A with Weir has been edited for clarity. What do you do at Discovery Education, and when did you start exploring the use of AI at the company? My job is to bring all the parts of product development together, to make sure we're building solutions that work for teachers and kids across content, curriculum, and design. We started looking closely at large language models nine to 12 months before ChatGPT came out and were stunned when we saw how good it had become. Advertisement How did you identify ways to deploy generative-AI applications at Discovery Education? Certainly we have machine learning and AI as part of our products. But we started asking ourselves what are tasks that happen over and over again where we are constrained from doing things quickly? One of the challenges has always been how to know that we're working on the right things in the right context. We have millions of kids and teachers using our products, and we get open-text feedback from all kinds of sources. AI helps us build all that feedback into themes a lot faster, instead of going through reams of Excel files and trying to relate different datasets to each other. Advertisement That's one of the most tangible opportunities we see â€” taking those bridging tasks that eat up our team's time and focusing them more on bringing solutions to problems our teachers and kids have. Is it easier to think of ways to use AI, since you're already steeped in technology? The pace of change in this space is faster than anything I've seen in my career. It's really about understanding where you want to place your bets. It feels sometimes like you could work on something for six weeks and then it's obsolete because there's a new way of doing things that's come out. One of the most important mantras we have is don't be a hammer looking for a nail. What's a problem that we've always wanted to solve that a large language model can now make better? Advertisement That's a question we have to keep asking ourselves, because as technologists it's very easy to get drawn into how compelling the technology is. It's harder to take a step back and say why is the use of AI or the application of it in this specific area compelling as a solution? We don't need to reinvent. Zoom came out with a feature where it can record a video and provide a summary â€” so we as a company probably shouldn't be trying to work on our own proprietary version of transcribing videos after a Zoom. It's not great to get too far ahead of the curve, because it might be a problem that people with far more resources are going to solve on your behalf. How have you organized your teams to foster and manage AI innovation? Advertisement For the executive team here at Discovery Education, our responsibility is to know where and how we're applying the technology. It's been like a hub-and-spoke model for us â€” decentralize it to some extent, with some guardrails, and then have someone who's kind of in the know at all the places we're trying it. An important aspect for us was having an AI policy , making sure that our internal employees knew what is appropriate use. In a very short period, anybody could do a lot of different things and send data to a lot of places. One thing I would encourage people to do is to make sure that where you're sending data is protected. If I think about what steps we've taken, that policy and discussion across the different functions and executive functions were important. For someone who works very closely with an engineering team, we probably have a bias to understand these things. You take it for granted the exposure you have in product development and engineering. Advertisement So one of the most important things was a big zoom-out on how this is going to affect all of us. It is going to affect our customers? How do we think about it as a whole, from HR to recruiting, and how do we apply the technology there? What advice do you have for a company that's just getting started on its own AI journey? I think it's important not to focus too much on your actual products and services but on all the ancillary benefits you can have, and talk about those cross-functionally. That was one of the smartest things we did very early on. You can encourage someone who may not have thought of a generative-AI application as benefiting them or similarly didn't see a risk that others see. Advertisement I think that dialogue has been constant for us, where we continue to talk about how we're applying it and what are the ethical uses of it, particularly in our industry, and then codifying that in a policy. As bureaucratic as that sounds, what we found is our employees are looking for guardrails. Our employees want to understand: Is the expectation that I'm using every single technology that's coming out there because I need to stay at the forefront of it? Where are we on that risk curve, and what do you expect from me as an employee? Another thing for us was to explain to our employees how we frame the use of this technology. In our industry, it's not meant to replace the teacher â€” it's meant to augment the teacher. If we're doing this well, it's seamless and people don't feel like AI is a verb. It's something that's just making you more efficient or better at what our purpose is, which is to help educate kids. We're a company, not a business unit, when we think about this. We're in it together, and we have to have an open dialogue about the evolving use and benefit of the technology. It's a conversation. Sign up for notifications from Insider!

Plus, a Filipino ice-cream cart is on the way for summer. Photography: Courtesy of Donut Papi / Luisa Brimble 1/18 Photography: Courtesy of Donut Papi / Luisa Brimble 1/18 Photography: Courtesy of Donut Papi / Luisa Brimble 1/18 Published on 15 November 2023 by Jasmine Crittenden Share After six years in its cosy Redfern space, Donut Papi has opened a flagship in Marrickville. Where the former shop was a low-key kitchen and takeaway counter, the new digs are big, bold and bright pink â€“ and dripping in strawberry glaze. Walking inside is like stepping into a big doughnut, says Kenneth Rodrigueza, who co-owns Donut Papi with his sister Karen. There's a pink drip [hanging from the ceiling] and the retail wall is framed in pink drip. It's all pink and all fun. What hasn't changed is Donut Papi's intense focus on two things: doughnuts and drinks. When you enter the store, the first thing you see is a glass-topped case displaying the doughnuts of the day. Beyond the counter are rows and rows of doughnuts, backdropped by the bakers in action. The entire creation process â€“ from frying to glazing to sprinkling â€“ is done on-site. Donut Papi's core range includes the Strawberry Milkshake â€“ a pink-glazed, sprinkle-topped homage to Homer Simpson â€“ plus classic American flavours like maple cream and apple fritter. The Rodriguezas's Filipino heritage often gets a nod, too: think purple yam beauties and the Ondeh Ondeh (pandan and coconut). Rotating specials keep fans coming back for surprises, and November brings a Filipino theme. The big hit is a doughnut based on ensaymada , a sweet and cheesy brioche. First, the team bakes a salted Basque cheesecake, then blends it and pipes it into a bombo doughnut, before crowning it with butter, sugar and grated cheese. Then there's the savoury Boy Bawang, based on the salty, garlicky Filipino corn snack of the same name. The doughnut is filled with a crunchy, creamy combination of garlic-infused corn nut and cheese, then topped with garlic butter and parmesan. Come summer, look out for Donut Papi's custom-made ice-cream truck â€“ it's been a long time coming. We had to delay it when we were in Redfern because the space was so small, says Kenneth. It's a traditional Filipino cart â€“ almost like a horse carriage â€“ with a freezer inside. Papi means father, so there's a painting of my dad's face on the front. He can't confirm what scoops will be inside, but doughnut ice-cream sandwiches are on the cards. There's a bunch of cool drinks to match the doughnuts, like the iced yema latte. A layer of house-made yema â€“ a caramelly, egg-based Filipino sweet â€“ is topped with ice, milk and a double shot of espresso. There's also iced matcha and a melon-lychee refresher. Those who want to soak up the store's vibes will need to be quick (or lucky), with only a few seats across a handful of tables. The flagship brings the Rodriguezas closer to their second concept, Gluten Free Friends , which opened in May just down the road.

The incredible @garrisonblock took these shots of Noel's exhibition, One and the Same, which went viral on @hypebeast and beyond. Noel is a Chicago-based artist who was commissioned by USM to create a bespoke series of pieces using the USM Haller modular system. Noel told us about his background, and his purpose as an artist. He works across media, exploring the essence, lifecycle, and cultural meaning of found objects, often repurposing them to generate new forms and configurations. Craft and unexpected use of materials is an important part of his process, and his collection for USM is a reflection of that. Noel showed us how his handmade hats, vests and gear relate to the way USM is constructed, but also draw from his experiences becoming an artist and interpreting the iconography in the world around him. Hats, merch and other goodies are available through Noel's web store, as well as his contact for those looking to commission work. #rarify #usmmodularfurniture #noelmercado #usmhaller #industrialdesign #chicagoartist #soho #nycdesigner .

This company has supported the State of Israel since 1966. DANONE - Group brands: Arvie, Badoit, Belin, BlÃ©dina, Phosphatine, Chipster, Evian, Galbani, Gervais, Heudebert, Lu, Taillefine, Volvic. Danone has just invested in the Golan, a Syrian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. NESTLÃ‰ - Group brands: Aquarel, Cheerios, Crunch, Frigor, Friskies, Galak, Golden Grahams, Kit Kat, Maggi, Mousline, NescafÃ©, RicorÃ©, Quality Street, Vittel, Perrier, Buitoni. The Swiss company owns 50.1% of the capital of the Israeli Osem food chain. The company has been accused since the 1950s of destroying the economy and health of the people of the third world, in particular with the imposition of its powdered milk for children in Africa, Asia and Latin America. INTEL - this large enterprise produces most of the PENTIUM 4 chips used by PC computers at its Kyriat Gat factory, located on the site of Iraq's Al-Manshiya, a Palestinian village razed to the ground after its eviction in 1949 by Egyptian soldiers . 2,000 inhabitants were driven from their land, despite a written pledge by the Zionists, monitored by the United Nations, not to touch the population. A campaign by their heirs to the USA in 2003 led INTEL to suspend a $2 billion investment project for an expansion of the Fab 18 factory in Kyriat Gat. L'OrÃ©al - Group brands: Biotherm Cacharel Giorgio Armani Parfums, LancÃ´me, Vichy, Roche-Posay, Garnier, Helena Rubinstein, Gemey-Maybelline, Jean-Louis David Shampooings, Le Club des crÃ©ateurs de beautÃ© (mail order sales of cosmetic products ), Redken 5th Avenue, Ralph Lauren perfumes, UshuaÃ¯a. L'OrÃ©al also invested millions creating a production unit in Migdal Haemeck, to the point that the American Jewish Congress expressed its satisfaction in seeing L'OrÃ©al becoming a warm friend of the State of Israel. ESTÃ‰E LAUDER - Group brands: Aramis, Clinique, La Mer, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger In addition to his investments, the director is the president of one of the most powerful Zionist organizations in the US, the Jewish National Fund. DELTA GALIL - this Israeli company specializes in the subcontracting of textile products, particularly underwear. Numerous underwear of foreign brands thus come directly from the factories of Delta Galil. This is the case of Marks & Spencers, Carrefour (Tex), Auchan, Gap, Hugo Boss, Playtex, Calvin Klein, Victoria's Secret, DKNY, Ralph Lauren. LEVI STRAUSS JEANS AND CELIO (depots specializing in men's clothing) These companies finance the new colonies in Palestine but also the schools of religious extremists around the world. TIMBERLAND (clothes, shoes, socks) - like his counterpart Ronald Lauder, Timberland President Jeffrey Swartz is an active member of the US Zionist lobby. He encouraged the US Jewish community to move to Israel but also sent Israeli soldiers to direct pro-Israeli propaganda in the US. DISNEYLAND - the Disney company has nothing idyllic about it and contributes, with its support to Israel, to sowing death in Palestine. It thus tacitly approves the illegal occupation of East Jerusalem by making Jerusalem the capital of Israel during an exhibition at the Epcot center in Florida, in violation of international UN resolutions. NOKIA - the Finnish telephony giant actively trades with the State of Israel. In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, the director of the group declared: that Israel was part of the company's priorities. A Nokia research center was thus born in Israel. MC DONALD'S - an emblematic enterprise of US cultural imperialism, the celebrated fast food restaurant chain provides significant support to the Israeli state. McDonald's has 80 restaurants in Israel and employs nearly 3,000 people there. He prohibits his staff from speaking Arabic. In the USA, the company appears among the partners of the Zionist organization Jewish Community based in Chicago. This organization works to maintain the military, economic and diplomatic aid provided by the USA to Israel. CATERPILLAR (construction equipment but also, clothes, shoes) - a broad campaign must be conducted to expose Caterpillar's criminal participation in the destruction of homes in Palestine with its giant bulldozers. It was with a Caterpillar that the Jewish American pacifist Rachel Corrie was killed by an Israeli soldier in 2003. The ACCORHOTEL hotel chain (Etap, Ibis, Mercure, Novotel, Sofitel) - this chain has many hotels in Israel, and recently, it opened a branch in the occupied Syrian territories, the Golan. The food chains present in the Israeli colonies: Domino Pizza hut Pizza Hut, HÃ¤agen Daaz, Burger King, Sigarette Morris ( Marlboro),Kimberly-Clarck (Kleenex, Kotex, Huggies), SanDisk (informatic), Toys RUS",positive,,EN,,,8,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,,1,danielasantanche,user{user},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,P00,,,C

I was grieving future deaths, knowing another generation wouldn't experience peace. I was grieving the loss of Jewish and Palestinian lives as well as the death of the dream of peace held for so long by so many Jews, Muslims and Christians. I was grieving future deaths, knowing another generation wouldn't experience peace. Gaskin: Hope amid mourning for peace in Israel Editorial cartoon by Steve Breen (Creators Syndicate) By Ed Gaskin November 15, 2023 at 12:18 a.m. When I saw the world's reaction to the massacre in Israel on Oct. 7, I was dumbfounded by the silence of some, the cheering of others, and the excuses and rationalization of many for the crimes Hamas committed against humanity. I couldn't believe righteous people had lost the ability to condemn sin and evil. A Ukrainian Jew remarked: When Russia attacked Ukraine, people flew Ukrainian flags. When Hamas attacked Israel, people flew Palestinian flags. I, like many Jews and Israelis, have no difficulty supporting Palestinian human rights and self-determination while also condemning the actions of Hamas. I've been puzzled as to why so many non-Jews can't. Antisemitism has been on the rise for years, but since Oct. 7, it has spiked alarmingly. As a result, Jews report being more self-conscious about being Jewish than ever before. Many have kept their children home from public school, avoided going to their synagogues, and tried to become less visibly Jewish, e.g., taking off a Star of David necklace or removing mezuzahs. In support of Israel, some wanted to fly the Israeli flag but feared communicating that Jews lived there. As I considered the world's reaction to Oct. 7, I concluded Israel has no natural friends or allies. Those on the far right, such as white nationalists, don't like Jews or Israel, but neither do those on the far left who support anti-Zionism or dislike U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East as implemented through Israel. Poor whites who fly Confederate flags don't like Jews, but neither do many rich gentiles, like Henry Ford. I still don't understand why there wasn't a boycott of Ford. For the last century, Blacks have allied with Jews on many issues, but not when it comes to the Palestinians. Remember, From Ferguson to Palestine. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are reliable allies. It's different for Blacks. We can usually count on support from Blacks from the African Diaspora, Hispanics, Democrats, liberal whites, various progressives, and college students. When one man, George Floyd died, there were Black Lives Matter protests around the world. When 270 died Oct. 7 at the Re'im music festival in Israel, there was silence in the world's capitals except for those protesting in support of the Palestinians. A few days later, people mistakenly thought Israel had bombed a hospital in Gaza, killing many Palestinian civilians. Again there were protests around the world. The only conclusion one could reach is that, unlike Black lives, Jewish lives don't matter. Blacks have often said non-Blacks can't know what it's like to be Black. On Oct. 7, I had an idea of what it was like to be a Jew: living in fear of unprovoked attacks, being self-conscious about being Jewish, and being unable to look to traditional institutions or allies for support. I regret that it took me a lifetime to realize this, and I apologize to the Jewish community. Yes, I had seen documentaries on the Holocaust and was familiar with Facing History & Ourselves, but my mental model was that people with white skin (like Ashkenazi Jews) who lived in the suburbs were immune from discrimination and hatred. I didn't know there was so much antisemitism in affluent suburbs, and when I learned about it, I didn't understand it. On Oct. 7, people said horrible things such as about time and Israel is getting a taste of its own medicine. Worse yet, these weren't comments from white nationalists or the ignorant. These types of statements came from leaders at Ivy League colleges. It is a low bar to say a recognized terrorist organization committed terror and you condemn terrorism. It's not the victims or perpetrators who make the Holocaust possible, it's the bystander majority. The silence of the bystanders to the horror of Oct. 7 rightly scares those who remember the Holocaust. My liberal friends are making a mistake by giving Hamas a pass because they believe it advances Palestinian aspirations. Hamas doesn't just hate Jews. Hamas is a terrorist organization that hates the West; is antidemocratic, anti-women, and anti-LGBTQ rights; and opposes religious freedoms â€” in theory, the values that liberals embrace. Not condemning Hamas' actions only encourages its agenda and emboldens similar terrorist groups. When I gathered with a small group in the home of a Jewish friend to discuss how to support Israel during this difficult time, I felt as though I was sitting shiva. I was grieving the loss of Jewish and Palestinian lives as well as the death of the dream of peace held for so long by so many Jews, Muslims and Christians. I was grieving future deaths, knowing another generation wouldn't experience peace. The fighting in Gaza perpetuates the lie that Jews and Arabs cannot live together in peace. Outside the West Bank and Gaza, about 18% of Israel's population is Muslim, and beautiful cities such as Haifa are home to Jews and Arabs alike. There are Jewish/Arab and Jewish/Muslim families, and many Jewish-Palestinian organizations working to achieve peace. Jews trust armed Palestinians to guard their neighborhoods and homes. Peace is possible. Israel's strategy to destroy Hamas is making the world less sympathetic to Israel, even though Hamas uses Palestinians as human shields. This further fuels antisemitism. As Sen. Chris Murphy has noted, for every terrorist killed, two more join the ranks. I fear that out of the ashes of Gaza will emerge Hamas 2.0, larger and more committed to the destruction of Israel than ever. I am reminded of how the United States left Afghanistan â€” after spending billions of dollars and losing thousands of lives â€” only to see the Taliban return to power. Like Hamas, the Taliban espouses an ideology that no army can destroy. Throughout Israel's history, from Egyptian captivity to the exile and through the destruction of the first and second temples, the prophets always had hope because they were able to see a future resurrection of life after death and destruction. As I experience my shiva moment for peace in Israel, I must have hope for a peaceful Israel and a life after death and destruction.

Trump is formulating his plans at a time when we're experiencing a crisis at the border and witnessing an unprecedented surge of illegal immigrants into the country because the Biden administration refuses to enforce the law. Opinion Lowry: Trump's border policy necessary corrective Migrants watch others stand next to the border wall in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico last winter, on the other side of the border from El Paso, Texas. (AP Photo/Christian Chavez, File) November 15, 2023 at 12:06 a.m. Let the panic over Donald Trump's immigration policy begin. The New York Times ran a piece the other day headlined, Sweeping Raids, Giant Camps, and Mass Deportations: Inside Trump's 2025 Immigration Plans. The reaction has been shock and outrage. Steve Benen of MSNBC wrote that Trump envisions a governing model in which the government actually rounds up people and puts them in camps. It is certainly true that what Trump envisions is sweepingly ambitious to the point of impracticality. The context matters, though. Trump is formulating his plans at a time when we're experiencing a crisis at the border and witnessing an unprecedented surge of illegal immigrants into the country because the Biden administration refuses to enforce the law. What's the proper response here? To trim the sails of Biden's policy, but largely accept it as the new status quo, even though no one in the mainstream would have considered it tolerable a few short years ago? The scale and urgency of Trump's plans are appropriate to the moment. The phrase mass deportation is one that gets people's attention (the New York Times headline alone will deter new arrivals, at least initially, if Trump takes office again). But we've now had years of mass illegal arrivals. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, there have been roughly 2.6 million who have immigrated illegally released into the country since January 2021, and another 1.5 million got-aways. That's 4 million people. No one voted to bring them here, and they aren't so-called Dreamers â€” they don't have longstanding ties to their communities. If they don't have legitimate asylum claims or some other legal standing, what right do they have to stay? Trump wants to use federal officers to round them up and hold them in temporary facilities on the border until they can be deported. As a practical matter, sending several thousand federal agents out to apprehend 4 million people in a vast country is not going to be easy. Among other things, the political resistance will be fierce. The very same blue cities that think it's been terrible that they've been made to accept so many illegal immigrants will turn around and say it's terrible that they're being made to go home. Still, if there are high-profile deportation operations, it will convince some people to leave voluntarily and some not to try to come. A more sustainable approach would be to use existing authorities to require those who entered the country without permission to register with the government or face a legal penalty; this would likely create an incentive for many to leave on their own power. An e-verify system mandating that employers ascertain the legal status of their employees would also remove the jobs magnet for illegal immigration. As for the border itself, the balance of the Trump agenda is to restore policies that were working, especially Remain in Mexico, at keeping bogus asylum seekers out of the country. Biden ripped these policies up for no good reason, and communities around the country have reaped the consequences.

It is composed of a mirror-finish metal disk installed adjacent to the wall. The LED light source contributes to create a warm atmosphere, and remains hidden from view. The body of the lamp thus seems to float in space, becoming part of the wall itself. The model generates engaging, refined games of light and perspective in the surrounding space. Halfway between a pendant and a ceiling lamp, Millimetro is composed of a very thin reflecting circular disk (1 mm thickness) and warm, enveloping light directed upward from below. The upper cap is attached to a stem that supports the metal disk with a mirror finish. The LED light source, concealed behind the disk, provides a diffused, uniform glow. To respond to various installation requirements, it is possible to choose from four different lengths for the stem that connects the body of the lamp to the ceiling attachment. The project stems from Daniel Rybakken's suggestion to create a lighting solution that would play with an effect, aimed upward and cast from above, thanks to a reflecting surface that generates a different perspective on the surrounding space. Thanks to its refined reflecting surface, it enhances the interior design of any space, bringing out the details seen from a reflected perspective.

Plus, will â€˜Meathead' from â€˜All in the Family' finally solve the JFK mystery murder? Why is Trump talking just like Hitler? | Will Bunch Newsletter Plus, will â€˜Meathead' from â€˜All in the Family' finally solve the JFK mystery murder? Published Nov. 14, 2023, 1:10 p.m. ET Worlds collided â€” along with a massive vehicle and a 6â€²7 human torso â€” when a hit-and-run driver in Center City plowed into new Sixers forward and instant fan favorite Kelly Oubre Jr. Saturday night. Nothing about an incident that shocked and scared Philly can be called good news, but a) Oubre's broken-rib prognosis is optimistic and b) maybe NOW the city will take seriously a crisis of pedestrian safety . But why does it take something like this? We've made a format change! Scroll down in the newsletter for the answers to last week's question about President Joe Biden running again in 2024, and a new question you'll definitely want to weigh in on. If someone forwarded you this email, sign up for free here . Trump isn't just blatantly copying Hitler's fascist language, but stealing his ideas, too Fascism doesn't occur naturally in human nature. Somebody had to invent it, and no one played a greater role than Benito Mussolini , an Italian World War I veteran who saw that a new kind of politics could arise from the charred ashes and bitter resentments of men traumatized by a conflict that had just killed 20 million. A vain and violent man, Il Duce taught Donald Trump how to strut on stage, posed shirtless generations before Vladimir Putin, and clung to power after 1922â€²s March on Rome by whipping up hate against leftists he described as vermin. Adolf Hitler picked up the ball from his 1920s hero Mussolini and ran with it â€” taking antisemitism to new lows by comparing Jews to filthy animals and parasites, years before his Nazi regime killed 6 million of them. After seizing power in 1933, the German FÃ¼hrer told a Czech minister that vermin must be destroyed. The Jews are our sworn enemies, and at the end of this year, there will not be a Jew left in Germany. His gutter language was adopted by the Third Reich's writers and editorial cartoonists who often depicted Jews as rodents, targets for elimination. Advertisement Maybe Trump was paying his own warped tribute to Hitler â€” the ultimate disgruntled war vet â€” when he chose Veterans Day to visit Claremont, N.H., and deliver an address that sounded just like a page ripped from a book of the German dictator's speeches that his first wife Ivana famously claimed the future 45th president of the United States kept by his bedside. We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections, said Trump , only days after a flurry of one-year-before-the-2024-election polls showed his campaign for another term moving ahead of President Joe Biden . He told voters in the key primary state that the threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous, and grave than the threat from within. He repeated the vermin bit on his Truth Social website, lest anyone missed it. Trump's vermin rant â€” and its seemingly deliberate echo of the 20th century's worst tyrants â€” will be remembered as something of a turning point. Although the embarrassingly timid New York Times nearly whiffed (Trump Takes Veterans Day Speech In a Very Different Direction was the initial headline from editors terrified of calling fascism by its name), by Monday multiple media outlets were expressing an appropriate level of horror over remarks by the GOP's all-but-certain nominee, and what they mean for American democracy. Still, I think the media is missing something about Trump and his campaign as it grinds inexorably toward Milwaukee and maybe 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. What may be forever known as the vermin speech was not the only time that Trump, aided by his past and future propaganda ministers like Stephen Miller, have plagiarized Hitler in ways that cannot be accidental. As Trump did on Saturday, Hitler famously rallied his Nazi Party supporters to take on the enemy within . In a recent campaign stop, the ex-president repeated a line hailing One people, one family, one glorious nation â€” a fairly blatant lift from the German autocrat's invocation of One people, one realm, one leader. The GOP frontrunner, in an escalation of his anti-immigrant rhetoric, also said not long ago that migrants to the southern border are poisoning the blood of our country , a deafening echo of Hitler's riffs on blood poisoning in Mein Kampf. (A Trump spokesman called it a normal phrase that's used in everyday life.) I study the breakdown of democracy, and I don't know how to say this more clearly: We are sleepwalking towards authoritarianism , Brian Klaas, political scientist at University College London and writer, said Monday on MSNBC's Morning Joe, noting the rise in fascist rhetoric can't be considered a coincidence. It's not. To the contrary, the intentionality here is stunning. Most of us in It Can't Happen Here America not only believe that our exceptionalism will magically and forever protect us from dictatorship, but also that anyone who tries to implement fascism will take a stealth approach, hoping to sneak his diabolical plan past a wise, democracy-loving electorate. But Trump is being deliberate. He desires not just to make himself a dictator, but to brag and mock us while he's doing it. How else to explain that not only is Trump talking like Hitler and Mussolini, but he has overt plans to act like them after Jan. 20, 2025. The latest example was reported in the same edition of the Times as the Veterans Day speech: a scheme to round up thousands if not millions of undocumented immigrants from coast to coast and place them in concentration camps, awaiting mass deportation. While Trump's worst ideas in his first term were often thwarted by more responsible public servants, the 2.0 model has a plan to install thousands of loyalists throughout the government â€” including a Justice Department where Trump seeks prosecution of anyone who wronged him. Is this plot to nuke the American Experiment really leading in the polls? It might be. The Washington Post's Philip Bump recently pointed to data that 38% of Americans think that things in the U.S. had gone so far off track that we need a leader who would break rules in order to fix the country's direction. Millions more â€” from CEOs wondering if dictatorship is better for the bottom line to Times editors afraid they might melt at the word fascism â€” can't or won't speak up. There are also millions of us determined to stop Trump's tyranny, or die trying â€” but we have a lot of work to do. For now, Team Trump is rubbing it in our face. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Monday that people comparing his boss's rhetoric to Hitler and Mussolini are clearly snowflakes grasping for anything because they are suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and their entire existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House. (He later clarified he meant to say their sad, miserable existence instead of their entire existence â€” as if that's better.) From somewhere intolerably warm, a bare-chested Il Duce surely crossed his arms, looked up, and smiled. Yo, do this Rob Reiner â€” then the precocious son of comedian Carl Reiner, later famous as the Meathead on All in the Family and a top Hollywood director â€” was 16 years old when President John F.

Idaho survivor who heard struggle but didn't call cops for hours has 'survivor's guilt': report Michael Ruiz November 13, 2023 at 7:59 PM Â·4 min read One of two University of Idaho housemates who survived a massacre one year ago today has transferred to a new school as she copes with trauma and survivor's guilt, her former stepmother said in rare public remarks. In court documents, police alleged that the young woman overheard parts of the intrusion, crying and other suspicious activity before she went into a frozen shock faze as she saw a masked man with bushy eyebrows leaving out the back door around 4:15 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022. But no one called the police until around noon, according to authorities.

BRYAN KOHBERGER TRIAL: SURVIVORS OF IDAHO MASSACRE WERE AWAKE, TEXTING DURING RAMPAGE: REPORT Madison Mogen, top left, smiles on the shoulders of her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves, as they pose with Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and two other housemates in Goncalves final Instagram post, shared the day before the four students were stabbed to death. There's a lot of guilt because, you know, if someone says, â€˜Oh, well, [she] was so lucky,' you know, you don't want to take on that luck â€“ because all of the children deserved luck, her father's ex-wife, Patricia Munroe, told the New York Post in an interview published over the weekend. ADVERTISEMENT READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP The victims were housemates Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21 and Xana Kernodle, 20, as well as Kernodle's boyfriend Ethan Chapin, 20. Despite her divorce from the survivor's father, she said she was very aware of the ordeal. She did not mention the 20-year-old's new school, citing online harassment and other concerns. IDAHO MURDER VICTIM ETHAN CHAPIN HONORED BY FRATERNITY AS FAMILY MARKS ONE YEAR SINCE SLAYING Bryan Kohberger arrives at Monroe County Courthouse in Pennsylvania on Jan. 3, 2023, for an extradition hearing. The 28-year-old former Ph.D. student is accused of brutally stabbing four University of Idaho students to death around 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022. I challenge anyone to be in a position where they wake up to four of their roommates gone and, you know, not even realizing it, she told the paper. People have to understand that these children are very youngâ€¦ You know, they're just young kids, and it's just a really traumatizing thing. I just think that people need to have compassion. ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement Her former stepdaughter was awake during the 4 a.m. home invasion massacre, in her second-floor bedroom. On that same level of the three-story home, two of the four victims were killed, according to police documents. She'd also heard noises upstairs â€“ which she initially attributed to one of her friends playing with a dog. Lights inside the King Road rental home were still lit up on Monday, Nov. 14, 2022. A surviving housemate told police she saw a masked man with bushy eyebrows leaving through the sliding door after overhearing suspicious noises. Then, according to the probable cause affidavit, she thought she heard Goncalves say, There's someone here. She peeked out of her room but didn't see anything. Around this time, according to investigators, Kernodle was still alive, using the TikTok app on her phone at 4:12 a.m. ADVERTISEMENT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S â€˜UNPRECEDENTED' PRETRIAL PRIVILEGES INCLUDE VEGAN FOOD, NEW SUITS, COMPUTER: VICTIM'S DAD The housemate soon thought she overheard crying from Kernodle's room, which was on the same floor, according to the affidavit. She peeked out and overheard a male saying, It's OK. I'm going to help you. She opened her door for the third time and saw a masked man in dark clothes with bushy eyebrows leaving through the rear sliding door. She described him later to police as not very muscular, but athletically built.

Police believe the four victims had all been stabbed repeatedly before 4:25 a.m. Police did not receive a 911 call until around noon. It came in from one of the survivors' phones, according to police, but they have declined to reveal who actually made the call. All four victims had been stabbed multiple times. Some were asleep at the start of the massacre. Investigators say there was a knife sheath with the suspect's DNA on it under Mogen's body. Bryan Kohberger, who turns 29 next week, was studying for a Ph.D. in criminology at the neighboring Washington State University at the time of the crime. He has a master's degree in criminal justice from DeSales University in Pennsylvania. ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement He declined to enter a plea at his arraignment in May.

Twenty women are challenging the state's abortion laws, saying they were unable to get the health care they needed for their medically complex pregnancies. Republish Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune's daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. When Kimberly Manzano's doctor first noticed some irregularities with her pregnancy, she turned to God, praying constantly for good news. When the diagnosis worsened, she and her husband sought comfort in the Bible's Book of Hebrews â€” the book of hope. And when her doctor finally determined her baby could not survive outside the womb, she asked her pastor for advice. He said, â€˜if you believe your doctor to be a godly man, take what the doctor says as clarity from God in your decision,' she recalls. Manzano and her husband, both devout Christians, decided the most loving thing they could do for their son was terminate the pregnancy. It was a difficult decision for the couple, who both considered themselves anti-abortion before this. But that decision, between the Manzanos, their doctor and God, would now have to involve another party â€” the state of Texas. Although continuing the pregnancy put her at greater risk for infection and illness, Manzano's life was not currently in danger, so her doctor would not terminate her pregnancy. Texas' abortion laws have no explicit exceptions lethal fetal anomalies. So she and her husband bought last minute flights to New Mexico. Her doctor refused to send her medical records to the clinic, instead requiring her to serve as the go-between. I was grieving, I was processing all of this, and then I was also feeling like a criminal, she recalled recently. It's dehumanizing â€¦ and it shouldn't be like this for health care. Danielle Mathisen, an OB/GYN resident, and her husband were thrilled when they got pregnant right on schedule. But after a devastating fetal diagnosis, they had to scramble to travel out of state for an abortion. Credit: Courtesy of Danielle Mathisen On Tuesday, Manzano and six other women joined an ongoing court challenge to Texas' abortion laws, bringing the total number of plaintiffs in the lawsuit to 22, including two doctors. The new plaintiffs, like the other patients on the lawsuit, allege they were denied abortion care in Texas for their medically complex pregnancies, including cases where the fetus was not expected to survive after birth. The suit, filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, claims the state's near-total ban on abortion violates their rights under the Texas Constitution. After an emotional hearing in July , a Travis County judge granted a temporary injunction that protected doctors who, acting in their good faith judgment, terminate complicated pregnancies. The Texas Office of the Attorney General immediately appealed that ruling , putting it on hold until the Texas Supreme Court hears the case later this month. The harms to pregnant women in Texas is continuing every single day, said Molly Duane, senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights. As more people learn about the lawsuit, they continue to tell us the same things are happening to them. Manzano's experience changed her mind about abortion, and she said she's sharing her story in hopes of educating people who don't realize how restrictive the state's abortion ban is. I think I was really naive, thinking the world was one way and going through this and seeing it's not like that, she said. But in the end, God knows my heart. He knows why I've been through this and I'll have to stand before him one day, and no one else. A doctor's dilemma From the first time Danielle Mathisen delivered a baby in medical school, she knew she wanted to be an OB/GYN. She also knew she wanted to be a mother. Mathisen and her husband met playing volleyball in high school in the Fort Worth area and got married in 2019. They tried to time her pregnancy around the intensive medical school schedule, and were thrilled when she got pregnant right on schedule during her fourth year. So thrilled, in fact, that her husband passed out at the first ultrasound appointment. He just heard the heartbeat and the passions of fatherhood overtook him, she said, only half kidding. Mathisen went in for her anatomy scan at 18 weeks. She'd just finished learning how to perform pregnancy ultrasounds, so immediately, she knew something was wrong. Nothing was where it was supposed to be. It felt like an out of body experience, she said. I thought the wires got crossed and it was the girl next door's ultrasound, because surely nothing could be wrong with my own pregnancy. Mathisen comes from a family of doctors. Her aunt was her OB/GYN, and Mathisen texted her from the exam room, asking if something was wrong. Her aunt sent back one word: Yes. Mathisen's daughter had a laundry list of diagnoses â€” a malformed brain, something wrong with the heart, a hole at the bottom of her spine, only one kidney. She was barely in the first percentile for weight. It just kept getting worse, which made the decision easier, Mathisen said. But this appointment was in September 2021, just a few weeks after Texas banned abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. The new law allowed private citizens to sue anyone who aided or abetted in a prohibited lawsuit. Mathisen had been on the other side of these conversations as a medical student, so she knew the fear her aunt was experiencing at that moment. We had the most legal conversation that we could have had, she said. And that conversation was, â€˜I'm sorry, I can't help you here. But maybe someone in another state could.' And I knew exactly what she meant. Mathisen and her husband went home shattered. Her mom, also a doctor, started calling clinics until she found one in New Mexico that was holding spots open for Texans. They bought first class tickets, the only ones left, and less than 24 hours after learning this heartbreaking news, were on their way to Albuquerque. Several people on the flight assumed they were going to Albuquerque for their honeymoon, a fiction they leaned into even after they returned to Texas. The abortion clinic was still operating under COVID-19 protocols, so Mathisen went in alone. In the exam room, there were journals where other patients had written messages of support â€” you're making the right decision, and you're doing the best you can with the information that you have, sentiments Mathisen has relied on in the days since. On the plane ride back, Mathisen submitted her OB/GYN residency applications. She's always wanted to practice medicine in Texas like the rest of her family, but part of her was relieved when she was accepted to a program in Hawaii. I felt really let down by Texas. I still feel really let down by Texas, she said. It just makes me mad and sad and angry and guilty because I know there are people in Texas that need the care that I know how to provide. But I cannot give it to them there. In Hawaii, when she encounters patients facing similar diagnoses, she can offer them the option she was denied â€” to terminate the pregnancy in a doctor's office or hospital at whatever point they feel ready to make that decision. I say to them, your heart can want one thing and your brain can know that this is still the right thing to do, she said. Your mama heart wants to hold your baby. I want to hold my daughter, I still do. But my brain knows this was the right thing to do. Mathisen is pregnant again, with another little girl. She hopes to one day be able to return to Texas, work as an OB/GYN and raise her daughter surrounded by all the strong female doctors who made her who she is. That's part of why she joined this lawsuit, she said.

We'll take Murano glass vessels and lights inspired by cabbages, root vegetables, and, yes decorative gourds. It's all part of the new collection by @dana.yolanda.arbib, which inaugurated the new, permanent @tiwa_select gallery in Tribeca last month. Among the designs, sconces appear to be sprouting fronds, or feature exaggerated vascular ridges that, in a couple of designs, also resemble hot dogs. The vessels look as if they're growing roots, or have handles that wave and crinkle like leaf edges, or are covered in warts typical of gourds (which, TBH, we just learned are the result of excess sugar production!). Green, orange, and yellow hues â€” ranging from subtle tints to bold pops â€” enliven the glass and mirror the drawing-room green color Tiwa founder Alex Tieghi-Walker selected for the window frames of the gallery. Arbib's pieces were shown amongst custom pieces made by spatial designer @currie.ritchie and vintage furniture contributed by the Queens-based gallery @thesomersethouse.

But our ears perked up with we heard one of America's largest and most celebrated office furniture brands had teamed up with the feted Japanese designer. The result is the Asari task chair, the latest collab between @hermanmiller and @naoto_fukasawa_design_ltd, and it is, expectedly, a resounding match made in functional, ergonomic, minimalist heaven. Asari means clam in Japanese, and here it's used as a metaphor for the design's nature-inspired soft shapes and rounded edges. My goal was to inspire joy and create a new form, ultimately becoming the next upholstered icon, Fukasawa says of his design â€” a lofty goal, but not an outsized one for a designer with nearly a dozen designs in the permanent collection at MoMA. The Asari is intended to fit seamlessly into domestic environments and hybrid work arrangements. Judging from the looks below, Asari will do just fine in that department, and we can think of just one more thing that would complete these serene domestic tableaux: With the return of physical media, can we pleeeeeez put pressure on @muji_global @mujiusa to bring back Fukasawa's wall-mounted CD player?! .

First came the styling credits for unabashedly chic interiors, like @studiogiancarlovalle New York apartment in @archdigest, or any number of the exactingly produced homes for @athenacalderone book, Live Beautiful. Then came the brand work â€” styling for the likes of Anthropologie, Hay, and B&B Italia â€” and the collabs: a collection of small goods for @audocph, rugs for @beni_rugs, and a collection for @westelm, among others. But things really began to ramp up when King's book, Arranging Things â€” a lavishly illustrated how-to guide to his own particular style â€” announced its 2023 release. By all accounts, a book by a stylist â€” normally a solidly behind-the-scenes job â€” is somewhat of a novelty; rarely does someone break out and make themselves known in the mainstream. But King has achieved just that, thanks in part to a brilliantly curated Instagram presence, which begat a legion of devoted fans. His style has been described as meditative and intuitive, synonymous with Scandi-ish magazines like Cereal and Ark Journal: quiet, spare, and rife with negative space, sepia tones, and endlessly long shadows. Sort of like if Dutch Master still-lifes were restaged with Noguchi lamps and stoneware pottery. Born on a dairy farm in Ohio and trained as a dancer in New York, King's path was undeniably unconventional, leapfrogging from adjacent careers like estate management and content creation until he found himself styling photoshoots almost entirely by chance. But the move seemed almost preordained. Once he got his foot in the door, his career exploded and he was soon working for publications like AD, The New York Times, and Elle Decor, which quickly evolved into design gigs for brands like West Elm and Beni Rugs, where he remains artistic director. We sat down with King to find out exactly how he made it all happen: from training celebrities with Tracy Anderson, calling up The New York Times's legal department to find out how to get published in T Magazine, to eventually launching his very own monograph earlier this year. .

Over time, as their designs have become more sculptural, the forms have grown even more organic and less angular. Before, we relied a lot on geometrical shapes â€” choosing two-dimensional geometries and bringing them together, says Dodd. As Tao explains, it's the difference between shape and form. The shape is two-dimensional and the form is three-dimensional, so now we've moved from shapes to form. In practical terms, that means there's a lot more carving that goes into our work, says Dodd. There's a fluidity to their pieces that comes, in part, from observing the contours of things out in the world and how they move. The Beaver Tail chair, which comprises 16 layers of stack-laminated wood, draws on the action of those industrious animals that live in the pond by the couple's country house. The Mono chair and tables can be traced back to their experience of an airshow in Toronto, looking at the patterns in the sky from the jets, notes Dodd. The Gossamer desk is like a continuous ribbon of wood. We've always thought that every piece we make needs to have a strong character and a strong expression, Tao says.

When we think of outdoor furniture, we tend to picture scenes from the middle of last century: pastel metal motel chairs on a well-manicured lawn, Gae Aulenti's curvilinear Locus Solus collection, seared into our mind's eye thanks to a starring role in the spicy 1969 film, La Piscine; Slim Aarons photographs with coiffed blondes, men in sports jackets, and some very Ã  propos white wire furniture accented with lemony upholstery, befitting of its Palm Springs setting, selling the heck out of the indoor-outdoor fantasy made possible by all that sunshine. But while mid-century absolutely crackled with big outdoor furniture energy, we've been, until recently, hard pressed to replicate that feeling in the current market. Sure, rattan furniture had a moment. The Roly Poly chair popped up in cool gardens everywhere. Hay became ubiquitous. But lately, we've been clocking a growing number of contemporary designers taking up the torch of inventive outdoor furniture design. It tracks alongside the growing collective awareness that nature is precious and that cultivating our feelings of belonging within â€” or even as â€” nature is more important than ever. On the site today, we caught up with three exciting talents on the scene: the LA-based @launlosangeles, headed up by Rachel Bullock and Molly Purnell, whose bent metal Ribbon collection was one of the first on the scene; the Guadalajara-based @peca_studio, whose founder Caterina Moretti tends to work in organic materials like Oaxaca black clay, volcanic stone, and travertine; and the Texas-based @muhly.studio, whose ball-footed stainless steel fire pit is one of the best reasons to spend time outside we can think of. #linkinbio âœï¸ @danamolly .

That urge, combined with the pandemic, led her to focus on creating furniture and what resulted is a sculptural collection that is both intimate and broad in its sweep, touching on the personal and familial but also the complicated history of colonialism. (The Democratic Republic of Congo declared independence from Belgian rule in 1960). MupangilaÃ¯ set out to use specific materials related to the Congo: Teak and stone are natural resources of the region, rattan is woven in traditional baskets and mats, and banana fiber references banana leaves involved in food preparation and presentation. The shapes and forms are both playful and weighted with meaning, like the Mwasi armoire, whose door resembles an African shield and whose astounding limb-like support evokes femininity and movement. (The names of these pieces include Mwasi and Bina, which mean woman and dance, in Congolese Tshiluba, one of the native languages spoken in the DCR.) In a recent conversation, MupangilaÃ¯ told us more about the research that went into this project (long phone calls with her dad, the old books he sent her inscribed with his name), what influenced her and what didn't, and how she developed a kind of design language to make these pieces say so much. #linkinbio âœï¸ @deborahcaryn .

He points to Hong Kong as a model of how it could be done. But Hong Kong's autonomy all but disappeared after China imposed a national-security law on the city in 2020. Today, Hong Kong is much less an advertisement and more of a cautionary tale for Taiwan. In the final episode of our four-part series looking at the future of Taiwan, David Rennie, The Economist's Beijing bureau chief, and Alice Su, our senior China correspondent, ask what Taiwan needs to do to protect its democracy. They meet Kacey Wong, an artist who fled to Taiwan after witnessing Hong Kong's loss of civil liberties. He explains what's at stake for the island he now calls home.

1221913039,WWW.DESTRUCTOID.COM,11/15/2023,NEWS,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/,Review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,"Review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 $70? $70? MSRP: $69.99 Aimless Playing through the 15-mission single-player campaign in Modern Warfare 3 often had me wondering if this game was better off not having a campaign at all. To Sledgehammer Games' credit, it seemingly developed this game in a fraction of the time of most annual releases, especially since it just released Vanguard two years prior. But, at the same time, this approach shows how unsustainable and unhealthy this development cycle is, with the messiest and worst campaign in the franchise to date. The 15 missions it has are deceptive, as players can finish them in a matter of three to five hours; much shorter than previous games. Screenshot by Destructoid Worse still, it eschews the jokes about the campaign being a tutorial for multiplayer in favor of being a glorified tutorial for the upcoming Warzone Urzikstan map. Many of the missions take place in larger map areas with a few objectives for players to accomplish and some freedom of choice in how to go about tackling them. This sounds fine and dandy as an idea, but in practice, it falls flat. Unwanted elements of DMZ and Warzone exist, such as the armor plates, looting supply crates, and parachuting around. There is almost no story hook throughout these missions and they pretty much act as a bridge to the next actual cutscene. Unfortunately, those cutscenes don't offer much to reward players for completing the campaign's bland tasks, either. The plot feels like a slightly expanded and redone version of 2022's MW2 with the same villain and little resolution. In fact, it even ends on a frustrating and weird cliffhanger. That said, there are the occasional traditional cinematic, action-packed linear campaign missions here and there. But even those aren't perfect. For instance, the opening mission Operation 627 plays like a wild and fun prison break adventure, but even it doesn't last long enough. Worse still, the campaign's No Russian sequel Passenger is unnecessarily controversial and egregious in its context. If there's any game where you can safely skip the campaign and not miss out, this is the one. Screenshot by Destructoid Playing without rose-tinted glasses Multiplayer remains king in Modern Warfare 3 and is where most people will likely spend their time. Another odd choice from Sledgehammer, but understandable given the harsh development timeline: remastering all 16 of the launch maps from the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2. As someone who came into the series just after that with Black Ops, this was pretty much my first time checking out the likes of Rundown, Karachi, and more. I will admit most of these maps haven't aged the best, especially with the current fast-paced movement systems. Last year's MW2 didn't have solid maps and, unfortunately, that trend continues this year with the latest game. A few of them are fantastic, such as Terminal, Invasion, and Skidrow, while most of the others were better left stuck in 2009. I'm torn because some game modes like Search & Destroy feel better than ever in this title. However, a tried-and-true mode like Hardpoint doesn't work well on almost any of the maps due to them not being made with it in mind. This led to me being even pickier than usual with what maps I play in multiplayer and less overall enjoyment. Screenshot by Destructoid Moving with grace My negative experience with most of the maps in MW3 feels even more painful because this year's model has the best movement and gameplay of any Call of Duty game not from the jetpack era. New additions like Tac Stance complement the smooth and improved returning mechanics like slide canceling and dolphin diving. There isn't a second of downtime in this game, which I love. As an SMG player who likes to always be in people's faces, I could zip across most maps in a few seconds and start blasting away at some unsuspecting opposing player. The speed of this game feels incredible and just right when paired with the higher-than-average player health. This results in a smart balance of swiftness and heft. While you can find enemies in no time, you need skill with the varied and impressive weapons to succeed. The crossover of all MW2 weapons and most cosmetics also means this game has a fantastic and familiar foundation for existing fans as well. This results in thrilling gameplay, which mismatches with many of the maps. Screenshot by Destructoid Hope remains Players looking for the best parts of MW3 should honestly look outside the usual trappings of campaign and multiplayer. Instead, game modes like Ground War offer some of the finest and most thrilling moments in this adventure. Ground War gave me the high-quality, Battlefield 3-like experience I've been sorely missing for a while now. This is because of its massive maps, large player counts, and onslaught of vehicles across land and sky. Pair this with the best-in-class movement and gunplay, and you have a grand time. At the same time, Treyarch cooked up a unique but welcome take on Zombies with the open-world Operation Deadbolt. This feels like the true successor to TranZit, my favorite Zombies iteration. It lacks some direction with the open-world maps and many objectives, but the horror aesthetic and countless undead forces give it a special sense of freedom. Screenshot by Destructoid It could use some tweaks when it comes to content, missions, and challenges, but this Zombies experience is off to a solid start. Overall, Zombies feels like the best part of 2022's DMZ but with a more compelling enemy threat. In the end, Modern Warfare 3 begs the question of whether this annual cycle should continue or not. Almost half the game feels shoehorned in, such as the forgettable campaign. Meanwhile, the other half has mixed results in the case of the multiplayer maps. But if players engage with the truly special parts of MW3, such as its exceptional improvements to gameplay and spectacular alternative modes like Zombies and Ground War, they'll find there is a worthy experience in there somewhere. 6 Alright Slightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More. Ever since Google took away free unlimited storage on Google Photos , I knew I'd have to figure out a way to keep my ever-growing photo library slim and lean. Google's existing tools are a passable point to get started, but they lack important context. That's why I'm very excited to get my hands on Google Photos' new photo stacks , which are supposed to group similar photos taken at roughly the same time in a stack much like Top Shot does. While this is primarily intended to make it easier to scroll through your library, it will also make it much easier to pick a single great shot and discard the rest. Google Photos and its bait and switch strategy To preface this, Google Photos used to offer a deal that was too good to be true. Up until June 2021, you could upload as many images and videos as you wanted to. Fair, this was limited to compressed images (now called storage saver) on most phones, but some Pixel handsets got unlimited storage for full-resolution images. Many other companies couldn't compete with this offer just based on the server cost, and people uploading millions of photos to the service only made it better at its core capabilities. Google Photos quickly became better and better at recognizing recurring faces of friends and family. Object recognition was also long unmatched, with Photos allowing you to search for things, animals, places, anything you could think of. A lot of competitors gave up in the process, leaving Photos as pretty much the only viable option on Android if you want a smart gallery. At some point, Google likely decided that it acquired enough data to train its image recognition algorithms and started thinking about actually paying the bills to keep the servers running. The company announced its switch to a paid model, with newly uploaded photos counting against your Google storage quota. To ease the transition, Google offered some customers a longer grace period. The company also introduced a number of tools to help you clean your Photos storage and an estimate of how long your current tier is going to last you when you keep uploading images the way you do. The existing storage saving options don't cut it for me To me, those tools always seemed a little half-baked and not perfectly useful. Within the Google Photos storage management screen, there are three options for you to choose from to review and delete content: one section lists large photos and videos, sorted from big to small, another section shows blurry photos, and one more gives you an overview of all your screenshots (or images that look like screenshots). It's true that these three categories are the most likely culprits clogging up unnecessary storage, but there is more to the story. A five-minute video is going to take up a lot more storage than an image, but videos deliver so much more context than an image could ever provide, allowing you to relieve a situation much more closely. That way, simply putting the biggest videos at the beginning of the list, suggesting to delete those first, is misleading. There is also no way to remove content from those sections or filter for specific image formats or dates, no matter which section you're looking at. Given all that, the three sections become mostly useless when you want to clean up your storage on a regular basis. You will be confronted with the same images and videos that you've decided to keep over and over again, making you question that decision. Close These clearly aren't even screenshots in that last image At the same time, all three sections are lacking context altogether. This is particularly problematic for blurred images. It's possible that some of these blurred images are the only photos you have of a given moment, so even if they're blurry, they're still so much better to have than not having them at all. All these factors combined just culminate in a lot of decision fatigue. This makes you more likely to just postpone your library cleanup or give up on it altogether, opting to buy more storage instead. Photo stacks make my library cleaner and help spot duplicates For me, the new photo stacks might finally be a game changer for clearing out storage, even if they may not originally be meant for this. Once they roll out to you, similar images will be stacked on top of each other, with only the best shot displayed as a cover image. The rest of the photos are still accessible when you view the best shot in full screen via a carousel at the bottom, though. In your library, these stacks are made visually distinct from regular photos with an icon in the top right corner and a number attached. Close I'm looking forward to Google helping clean up these duplicates This feature is primarily meant to make it easier to browse your library. Rather than seeing a lot of repetitive shots of the same thing, you can more easily sift through hundreds of different events in your timeline. However, if you're on a quest to free up some storage, you can use this same feature to clean up your library. With it, Google already does all the heavy lifting for you, giving you an easy way to detect all bursts of similar photos you have. You can then just visit each stack, review which of the images in it is truly worth keeping, and straight-up delete the rest. Using photo stacks to clean up your library also has the advantage that you can see the context of your images. As mentioned, the existing cleanup tools just show you suggested photos in isolation, making you second-guess if you can really delete them or if you should keep them for the sake of having any picture of whatever it is you photographed. With photo stacks, you can clearly see which other images of the day you have. We will hopefully see more smart ways to help cut down on storage Google Photos is now more than two years into paid storage, and we can only hope that Google will bring more features like this to the table. Photo stacks will likely help me cut down on a lot of excess already, but I think Google could take it further. For one, the existing cleanup tools could get smarter. Google could allow us to mark images and videos we'd like to keep even if they're blurry, big, or look like screenshots. Close Mockup of a Google Photos cleanup mode with labels for large files, blurry images, and screenshots For another, Google could add a cleanup view to the library itself, giving you information about size and perceived blurriness right in the library. This would make it possible to understand what these images look like in context, and which you can delete without worrying about losing key information. Or, you know, Google could bring back free storage. Subscribe to our Newsletters!

Western media carpet-bombed the news cycle with pro-Israel propaganda and a narrative that would distract from the fact that Israel was engaged in a barbaric genocide of an entire people and that the whole edifice of the presumptuous western civilisation and democracy was a big fat lie. Here are the top 10 propaganda points western media were pushing on behalf of their favourite settler-colony: Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked 1) The conflict began on 7 October, following Palestinian fighters' attack on Israel President Joe Biden declared the 7 October attack as equivalent to 15 9/11s for Israel, which western outlets similarly argued. It is not, however. Before 7 October, there was 6 October, and before that was a succession of dates and facts in a murderous colonial project of domination and dispossession going back to the Nakba , or catastrophe, of 1948. Before that was the racist Balfour Declaration of 1917, deliberately designed to get rid of European Jews, which was preceded by European misadventure into the heart of the Arab and Muslim world and the rise of Zionism as a settler-colonial movement. And before that still was Christian Zionist zealotry, lobbying to force Jews back to Palestine to expedite the coming of their Messiah. While the Israeli government and its Zionist propagandists wish to fetishise 7 October, we are here to de-fetishise and historicise it The succession of Zionist terrorist attacks on defenceless Palestinian civilians includes the massacres of Deir Yassin (1948), Kafr Qasem (1956), Khan Younis (1956), Sabra and Shatila (aided and abetted by Israel, 1982) and countless others. Israel was founded on the bloodshed and broken bones of Palestinians long before 7 October 2023. The world also continued after 7 October, when Israel commenced yet another genocidal attack on 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. While the Israeli government and its Zionist propagandists wish to fetishise 7 October, we are here to de-fetishise and historicise it. Ahistorical 2) Palestine is Hamas Palestine is not. Israel and its US and European accomplices have equated Hamas with the entirety of Palestine to discredit their entire resistance and liberation struggles. Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage for the latest on the Israel-Palestine war 3) Hamas is ISIS It is not. ISIS, or the Islamic State group, was a rootless, violent gang created and conditioned by the US invasion of Iraq . Fortunately for Palestine , Palestinian fighters represent a deeply cultivated and historically conscious Palestinian population collectively resisting the Zionist thievery of their homeland. No, Piers Morgan is not impartial on Israel-Palestine Palestine is not Hamas. Palestine is its heroic people, its generations of scholars, historians, artists, novelists, playwrights, poets, filmmakers, scientists, physicians, engineers, revolutionary thinkers and activists. Israel and its American and European enablers are no match for Palestinians. 4) The situation in Palestine is a humanitarian crisis It is not. It is an awe-inspiring national liberation struggle and will remain that way even if Israel, the US and Europe continue to conspire to fragment and dismantle it into more refugee camps. Palestinians are not going to be liquidated into a humanitarian crisis. Israel and the US may force them into Egypt, as they have been forcing them into Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, or any number of other neighbouring countries. But they will not disappear into thin air. They will regain and return to their homeland. Propaganda machinery 5) The BBC and the New York Times are the best specimens of objective journalism They are not. They are deeply compromised and discredited propaganda machinery most of the time parroting Israeli talking points. Fortunately, the world is no longer at the mercy of these outfits. Glaring facts and superior analysis of global opinion-makers are far more effective than the columnists of the New York Times and reporters of the BBC. 6) Palestinian fighters hide among the civilian population Another falsehood. Palestinian fighters are deeply rooted in the hearts and minds and aspirations of the Palestinian people. They did not fall from the sky. They do not hide among the population. They emerged from that population. They are their sons and daughters, husbands and wives, children and grandchildren. The assumption that they hide among the civilians is a barefaced racist assertion by those who believe Palestinians are not human beings. Israel faces the steely determination of a nation, not a collection of isolated guerrilla organisations. 7) Palestinian casualties are exaggerated and untrustworthy This is the propaganda point of the New York Times and the Washington Post for Americans and BBC for Europeans, which formed the phrase Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry, as if the details of Israeli casualties are independently verified by the International Criminal Court. When the New York Times or BBC state the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry, we read the phrase back at them: the pro-Israel biased news outfits discredit Palestinian suffering. Reactionary lies 8) The reactionary Zionists writing for the New York Times now warn their readers of 'the emergence of an Arab street inside the West' What does that even mean? They argue: The recent protests in European capitals, especially, are less an extension of a radicalised progressivism than a straightforward expression of ethnic and religious solidarity with the Palestinians on the part of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants. Despite racist assertions that only Middle Eastern immigrants are protesting, the millions of people standing in solidarity with Palestinians is not 'the Arab Street' This is a racist xenophobic attempt to brand and alienate a whole new fact of citizenship in the US and Europe. Millions of people protesting against Israel and in solidarity with Palestinians is not the Arab Street. These courageous demonstrators are Americans, British, Germans, French, Italian etc, and they are there not to allow genocide in their name. And they are not only in the streets. They are on university campuses, in law firms, centres for research and scholarship, in factories and workshops, and of course, serve on editorial boards and in university administrations. 9) The same reactionaries warn of 'the dilemmas of progressive Jews and Zionist Democrats' Again, what does that mean? If the pressures on European elites come from multiple directions, the pressures on American Jews and Zionists inside the Democratic coalition push just one way: toward the right, they state. Yet there is no such dilemma. If you are a Zionist, you believe in a racist, apartheid state . Period. There have always been critical and conscientious Jews on the side of Palestinians and there are millions of Christian and Muslim Zionists on the side of Israel.

Economic woes put the Chinese leader in a more vulnerable negotiating position on this visit. Xi Jinping arrives in the US as his Chinese Dream sputters Published Mr Xi faces a host of problems at home as he arrives in San Francisco By Tessa Wong Asia Digital Reporter, BBC News When Xi Jinping stepped off his plane in San Francisco for the Apec summit, it was in circumstances very different to the last time he landed on American soil. Five years ago, when he was wined and dined by Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Xi was in charge of a China still on the ascendancy. It had a buoyant economy outperforming forecasts. Its unemployment rate was among the lowest in years. While consolidating his power for a second term, Mr Xi proudly pointed to China's flourishing growth model as something other countries could emulate. By then, cracks were already appearing in what he calls his Chinese Dream. They have only widened since then. One view is that because of this, Mr Xi is in a more vulnerable negotiating position this time, though expectations of major breakthroughs are low. Xi's trips to Iowa: Tractors and Star Trek wallpaper After an initial bounce back, the post-Covid Chinese economy has turned sluggish. Its property market - once a key driver of growth - is now mired in a credit crisis, exacerbating a domestic debt bomb that has ballooned from years of borrowing by local government and state-owned enterprises. Many of these issues could be attributed to China's long-predicted structural slowdown finally making itself felt - painfully. In the last two years crackdowns on various sectors of the economy , as well as prominent Chinese businessmen, have caused uncertainty. These have recently widened to include foreign nationals and firms, heightening worries in the international business community. Foreign investors and companies are now moving their money out of China in search of better investment returns elsewhere. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, A real estate crisis is one of China's biggest economic problems currently Youth unemployment has skyrocketed to the point that officials no longer publish that data. A fatalistic ennui is spreading among young Chinese, who talk about lying flat or leaving the country in search of better prospects elsewhere. Mr Xi is also struggling with issues within his carefully-constructed power structure. The unexplained disappearances of key members of his leadership team and military top brass could be seen as either signs of pervasive corruption or political purges. Some observers have contrasted China with the US, whose economy has weathered the post-Covid recovery better. Until recently, Americans may have feared the day China would overtake them as the world's largest economy, but now analysts doubt if this will happen . Do China's vanishing officials spell trouble for Xi? China's current economic challenges will be an important factor in Mr Xi's negotiations and would lead to a stronger desire to stabilise the economic, trade and investment relations with the US, Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told the BBC. Mr Xi will want to receive reassurance from Joe Biden that the US will not expand its trade war or tech rivalry, nor take additional measures to decouple economically. Beijing has complained vociferously about the US imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, blacklisting Chinese companies, and restricting China's access to advanced chip-making tech. The fact they are meeting in San Francisco, home of Silicon Valley and the world's leading technology companies, will not be lost on the two leaders. There is speculation they may announce a working group to discuss artificial intelligence, which the Chinese reportedly hope to use to persuade the Americans not to further extend US technology export restrictions. With Taiwan's election round the corner, which has the potential of becoming a flashpoint, Chinese officials have made it clear they want the US to steer clear of supporting Taiwanese independence. But the US has repeatedly emphasised its support for the self-governed island in the face of Chinese aggression and claims over it. Taiwan remains a dicey tightrope for both countries. US officials are also seeking a resumption of military-to-military communications and Chinese cooperation in stemming the flow of ingredients fuelling the fentanyl trade in the US - and there are already reports that the Chinese will agree to these. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Supporters of Chinese president Xi Jinping gathered in San Francisco for his arrival Chinese state media has pressed pause on the US-bashing, releasing a raft of commentaries extolling the merits of resetting relations and working on cooperation. There is talk of returning from Bali, heading to San Francisco. This is a reference to the last time Mr Xi and Mr Biden met in person - at the G20 Bali summit almost exactly a year ago - which marked a high point in recent US-China relations before plunging to the nadir of the spy balloon incident . The propaganda preparations for the Xi-Biden meeting this week are making it clear it is okay to like America and Americans againâ€¦ I think you could make the argument the propaganda 180 makes Xi look like he is quite eager for a stabilised relationship because of at least economic if not also political pressures, China analyst Bill Bishop wrote this week. Mr Xi also appears equally, if not more, keen to woo the US business community. The US is quietly arming Taiwan to the teeth The BBC understands he will be the guest of honour at a ritzy dinner on Wednesday night organised especially for him to meet top corporate executives. In what could be a sign of his true priorities, Chinese officials had initially demanded the dinner take place before Mr Xi's meeting with Mr Biden, according to a Wall Street Journal report. But the Americans should also not expect Mr Xi to be arriving hat in hand and eager to please. Many believe mutual suspicion will endure and the two leaders will not likely remove existing trade and economic roadblocks put up in the name of national security. Mr Biden has preserved many of the Trump-era sanctions aimed at China, while initiating and then deepening the chip tech ban. Meanwhile Mr Xi has enacted a wide-ranging anti-espionage law, which has seen raids conducted on foreign consulting firms and exit bans reportedly used on foreign nationals. The two sides are also likely to not budge on core interest issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, where Beijing continues to build up its military presence to defend sovereignty while Washington does the same to reinforce its alliances in the region. Faced with the need to not appear weak to the US, Dr Li says, it's a difficult balance that the Chinese leadership has to strike - between the objective of seeking a more stable and positive relationship with US on one hand, and also appear to be strong and resilient against some of the American pressures.

1221913309,WWW.BBC.COM,11/15/2023,NEWS,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231114-time-travel-what-if-you-met-your-future-self,Time travel: What if you met your future self?,"Time travel: What if you met your future self? Imagining a conversation with future you has multiple benefits for your wellbeing, says psychologist Hal Hershfield. Imagining a conversation with future you has multiple benefits for your wellbeing, says psychologist Hal Hershfield. By Hal Hershfield 15th November 2023 Imagining a conversation with future you has multiple benefits for your wellbeing. There's a classic short story by Ted Chiang in which a young merchant travels years ahead and meets his future self . Over the course of the story, the man receives warnings, promises and tips from the older, wiser version of himself. These premonitions then change the course of the merchant's life until he eventually becomes an older man, who meets his younger self and imparts the same wisdom. Scenarios like this are wildly popular and have been explored in many other novels as well as in movies like Back to the Future, and TV shows as diverse as Family Guy, Quantum Leap, and the BBC's own Doctor Who (see The Doctor meets The Doctor below). For obvious reasons, these narratives have always been relegated to the realm of science fiction. But what if â€“ and it is a big what if â€“ you could meet your future self? What a very strange question, but one that I believe is worth asking. I'm a psychologist and professor, so I recognise that talking about the hypothetical implications of time travel may sound strange coming from someone in my career. But my research over the last 15 years isn't all that far off from this theme. I've largely focused on how people think about and relate to their future selves, and I recently published a book on the topic . In it, I explore the reasons why we have such a hard time making long-term decisions, and how â€“ by improving the emotional connections we have with our future selves â€“ we can ultimately make better choices. To mark the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who , we're exploring the big questions about time, including the science of time travel, how clocks have shaped humanity, and even the mind-bending temporal consequences of flying into a black hole. Read and watch more from Time: The Ultimate Guide . In my research, I've learnt that we often imagine our future self as another person. That tendency can create problems for us. To get a sense of why, think about someone in your life who you barely know: a neighbour or a co-worker, for instance. If that stranger asked you to make a sacrifice for their benefit â€“ say, to lend them money â€“ you might politely decline. If we treat our future selves the same way, then it makes sense why we sometimes give in to short-term desires (like buying a higher-end TV or car) rather than do something we'll feel better about in the long run (saving for a vacation next summer). If only we could try to make our future selves seem less like strangers: people like our partners, loved ones, or best friends. One way to bridge the emotional gulf is to think of future selves in more concrete and vivid ways. What's vivid is emotional, and what's emotional can kick us into action. In one recent study , for instance, my collaborators and I partnered with a bank and found that when customers were shown age-progressed images of themselves alongside encouraging messages about saving for retirement, they were about 16% more likely to make a retirement contribution than people who solely received the encouraging messages. Other work has found that writing letters to â€“ and then from â€“ one's future self can similarly strengthen the connection between current and future selves. WATCH: Can you learn to predict the future? Admittedly, showing people images of their older face, or having them engage in a hypothetical conversation, are far cries from actually meeting one's future self. But it's conceivable that far richer interactions may happen in the near future through artificial intelligence. (Read more: The A-Z of AI: 30 terms you need to understand artificial intelligence .) What if an AI model akin to Chat-GPT or Bard could be trained on the life experiences of individual people? These models have become astonishingly smart by learning from vast datasets about how human beings communicate, and they essentially work by making predictions. If such a model incorporated things like your birthplace, educational history, personality, relationships and hobbies â€“ and those of millions of other people too â€“ it might be able to make a prediction about the person you will be in 10 or 20 years' time. To be clear, the model wouldn't be predicting exactly what choices you'd make. It'd be more about showing your potential, based on the lives of people similar to you: not just one possible life for you, but rather, the most possible life path for you. The Doctor meets The Doctor As a time traveller, it's perhaps not surprising that Doctor Who has met themselves more than once. Yet despite their wisdom and experience, they often treat each other as strangers â€“ spending their encounters bickering, criticising their counterpart's clothing, or commenting on the redesigned Tardis. Watch: Three times The Doctor met themselves . Now, imagine conversing with that future version of you in the same way you might chat with a friend or loved one now. What would you ask? My own knee-jerk response â€“ and that of other people I've discussed it with â€“ is often resistance. The source of this, I think, boils down to our desire to see ourselves as unique. How, we wonder, could an algorithm make a prediction about me â€“ me with my many-coloured feathers that make me one in eight billion? Yet I must accept â€“ grudgingly â€“ that I am not as unique as I like to think, and algorithms already predict my personality, desires and choices on a regular basis. Every time I listen to a personalised Spotify playlist, or love a Netflix film recommendation, a form of AI has predicted it. As these algorithms get more powerful, with greater access to data about us and other similar people, there's no reason they couldn't go beyond surface-level details like your future self's entertainment choices. They might be able to predict how the older, wiser version of you might feel about the decisions in your life. Eight questions to ask future you So, to return to my original question: if you could time-travel to meet your future self, what aspects of your life would you want to know more about? Which ones would you prefer to be shrouded in secrecy? And if you'd pass up on the meeting, why? I've been thinking a lot about what I would do. My first instinct would be to ask my future self things likeâ€¦ are you happy? Are your family members happy and healthy? Is the environment safe for your grandkids and great-grandkids? Taking time to think about the conversations you would have with your future self can help to improve the choices you make (Credit: Getty Images) The more I considered these initial questions, the more I realised just how much I was concerned with what the future holds. A very informal survey of my wife and a few friends suggests I may not be alone in this tendency. But reflecting on it further, I realised that the most powerful questions would be ones that helped me make better choices today. With that as the goal, I might generate several queries meant to kick off a dialogue between my two selves, such as: â— What have you been most proud of and why? â— In what ways â€“ both positive and negative â€“ have you changed over time? â— What's something that you miss most from earlier in your life? â— What actions have you regretted? â— What actions did you not take that you regret? â— What's a time period you'd most want to repeat? â— What things should I be paying more attention to now? â— Which things should I stress about a little less? Imagine if you were to put these eight questions to your future self. What might you find out that would modify how you live now? It'd probably be the most important conversation of your life.

Find out more about how we test. Review information Available on: Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC Release Date: November 17 Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin is all about accessible, visually satisfying fantasy violence. Though this RTS from Frontier Developments fails to challenge the established genre conventions, the game is often joyful and stirring. However, narrow unit rosters and a flawed single-player campaign hold the fantasy strategy game back from true greatness. Realms of Ruin takes place in Games Workshop's sprawling Age of Sigmar universe and marks the first RTS to ever take on the bombastic and larger-than-life setting. When it comes to capturing the fantastical spectacle and violence of Age of Sigmar, Frontier Developments has acquitted itself well. Towering golden Stormcast Warriors are brought to life with fluid animations and modern graphics, as are their villainous adversaries. That said, though the main single-player campaign does lovingly capture the characters and aesthetic of Age of Sigmar, it also feels incomplete. Without a map or an intelligible framing device, the linear battles on offer seem disjointed - especially since the campaign jumps around the central factions liberally. As well as the gold-clad Stormcast Eternals, you'll also find yourself commanding the cunning Orruk Kruleboyz, the eldritch Disciples of Tzeench, and the ghostly Nighthaunt; seeing more than the occasional fight from their perspectives. The single-player campaign does lovingly capture the characters and aesthetic of Age of Sigmar This breadth often makes the campaign feel stretched thin. Though the impressive, motion-captured cutscenes are a real treat for fans of the setting, there's little connective tissue to bind the stirring setpieces together. Combat in Reams of Ruin suffers from the opposite issue. Though accessible, the game's core combat mechanics and unit rosters are simple, pared-down affairs that will leave those hungry for a deeper RTS experience left wanting more. Fight club (Image credit: Frontier) Realms of Ruin boasts an accessible strategy formula that, though easy to learn, skimps on depth at times. It starts with a classic unit triangle. Offensive melee units beat defensive melee units which, in turn, are resistant to ranged damage. Rounding out the triangle, ranged units are great at picking off lightly armored offensive troops. You send out your units from a single base to secure victory points and control points. The latter nets you resources that you can use for new units and upgrades. while, should you hold a majority of victory points for long enough, you'll win the match. It's a tried and trusted formula that will be familiar to fans of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 2 and Company of Heroes 3 . Best bit (Image credit: Frontier Developments) One campaign mission followed Sigrun and a group of Stormcast stragglers taking the fight to an Orruk leader. This culminated in a dramatic and moving cutscene that saw a battered Sigrun suffer a grievous injury. The motion capture allowed for compelling and realistic character expressions which helped sell the emotional weight of the scene. As a basis for a strategy game, these qualities are hardly a misstep. However, thanks to the lack of unit variety and the inescapability of the unit triangle, you'll often find yourself stuck in predictable skirmishes with even more predictable outcomes. Regardless of micromanagement from either side, I know that my shield-bearing Stormcast Liberators will always make short work of ranged specialists like the demonic Horrors of Tzeench. In a straight-up fight, the outcome is, essentially, predetermined. This predictability is reinforced by the â€˜sticky' quality of Realms of Ruin's melee combat. Once your units get bogged down in close quarters, they can't leave unless they either wipe out the enemy or retreat. This removes opportunities for movement-based micromanagement, making for an experience as reminiscent of auto battlers as it is of a full-blown RTS. (Image credit: Frontier Developments) That said, the numerous active abilities available to almost every unit do offer a much-needed extra layer of strategy. All offensive units can charge, allowing them to plow forward into targets with impunity. Heroes, too, often come with powerful temporary buffs or area-of-effect attacks. The variance across the units and factions here is impressive. Upgrade them properly and your usually melee-oriented Karic Acolytes can learn to throw bolts of sorcerous energy at range. Your Stormcast Liberators can use theirs to gain a temporary shield. Orruk Gutrippaz can bang on their shields, buffing allies and striking their enemies with fear. However, these contrasting abilities change the pace of combat infrequently on account of their cooldowns. For the most part, you can set and forget your combats, returning every so often to activate the occasional ability as it becomes available again. It's fun - but hardly the frantic micromanagement - with all the excitement and tactical possibilities this can bring - of Command and Conquer or Starcraft 2. Lost in the realms (Image credit: Frontier) Realms of Ruin places a significant emphasis on its single-player campaign. Here, fans of Age of Sigmar will find themselves very much at home. The story follows Sigrun, a Stormcast leader who is attempting to turn the tide in her army's ongoing war with the Orruks by venturing out from her fortress of Harkanibus to retrieve a powerful artifact. The facial movements of the central characters are impressively realistic The narrative unfolds in an old-school, linear fashion. You watch a cutscene, play a mission, and then watch some more cutscenes. The cinematics themselves are excellent and set a new bar when it comes to visual fidelity in RTS storytelling. The facial movements of the central characters are impressively realistic, often portraying subtle hints of emotion that would have been impossible to convey with older technology. In one moving scene, Iden, Sigrun's second-in-command, witnesses a duel between Sigrun and an Orruk leader. His eyes twitch and his face drops with all the emotion and pathos you'd expect from a bona fide human. (Image credit: Frontier Developments) Despite the strength of these cutscenes, the story itself feels disjointed. There is very little exposition. The opening crawl uses a lot of proper nouns. Even as someone familiar with the setting, I found myself untethered. Why is Sigmar important? Why are the Stormcast fighting for him? What is Harkanibus like and why is it important for us to defend it? Realms of Ruin uses an extremely narrow lens to tell its story and suffers for it. Fortunately, this sense of aimlessness does not apply to the game's multiplayer systems.

Joining the global efforts to govern AI, United States President Joe Biden last month issued an executive order to promote the safe, secure, and trustworthy use and development of AI by addressing broad issues related to privacy, misinformation and discrimination. The order, signed by Mr. Biden on October 30, lays down a preliminary set of guidelines for American companies and federal agencies to follow when dealing with the design, acquisition and deployment of advanced AI systems, with security as its core, and before making such technologies available to the public. Mr. Biden has insisted that the order is the most significant action any government in the world has ever taken on AI safety, and also called upon the Congress to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech platforms from collecting the personal data of citizens. The latest action follows the AI Bill of Rights issued by President Biden last October, and voluntary commitments from technology giants to comply with safety standards for AI. Before this, the Trump administration had also issued an EO in 2019 which laid out basic standards for the use of AI. Also Read | The potential of generative AI: creating media with simple text prompts What is an executive order? The President manages the operations of the executive branch of the U.S. federal government through executive orders (EO). These are signed, written and published directives from the President to the executive branch. Only a sitting U.S. President can issue such orders to clarify and further existing laws, or overturn an existing EO by issuing another order to that effect. An EO is not a legislation and doesn't require the approval of the Congress. It can, however, be subject to review by either Congress or courts, or both. Joe Biden signs sweeping order to regulate AI in U.S, days before Sunak's AI safety summit Executive orders have primarily dealt with regular administrative affairs and the internal operations of federal agencies. However, in recent times, Presidents have used such orders to implement policies and programmes. Mr. Biden has issued over 120 executive orders since he took over as the U.S. President in 2021. How does the executive order seek to regulate AI? A to I of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence, as defined in the order, is any computer system or application that performs tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, decision making, or natural language processing. The EO signed by Mr. Biden lists eight principles and issues directions that companies must follow while dealing with AI tools and tech. As per the text of the order, the issued directions will be implemented and fulfilled anywhere between 90 days to 365 days. Here's how President Biden's landmark Executive Order on AI will ensure America leads the way in this period of technological change while keeping Americans safe. pic.twitter.com/SvBPxiZk3M â€” The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 30, 2023 Safety and Security Emphasising the safety and security of AI due to its growing capabilities and potential implications, the order invokes the Defense Production Act, which is mainly used in critical moments such as war. The Act was last used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Racist, sexist, casteist: Is AI bad news for India? Companies developing powerful AI models that could pose a risk to national security, economic security, or public health and safety will have to notify the U.S. federal government when training such a system and share results of safety tests. Separately, the heads of government agencies will have to publish an annual report on potential risks related to the use of AI in critical infrastructure areas, including an assessment of how technology could be deployed to render infrastructure systems more vulnerable to critical failures, and physical and cyber attacks. To ensure that AI systems are safe, secure and trustworthy, the order sets standards for testing such models and addressing risks to critical infrastructure and cybersecurity. As per the order, the National Institute of Standards and Technology will set the standards for extensive red-team testing (structured testing to identify potential flaws and vulnerabilities in an AI system) to ensure safety before public release, while the Department of Homeland Security will apply those standards to critical infrastructure sectors and establish the AI Safety and Security Board. The Department of Energy and Homeland Security will, meanwhile, deal with serious chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks associated with the development of AI tools and technologies. The department is also tasked with r finding ways to mitigate such threats. . Notably, the mandate does not apply to AI systems that have already been developed and are available to the public. Image for representation only The order further directs action to safeguard the privacy of Americans and protect them from AI-enabled fraud such as deepfakes, which use AI-generated audio and visual content. The Department of Commerce has been tasked with developing standards to label AI-generated content to make its detection easier â€” also known as watermarking . So far, such labelling has proved ineffective as AI-generated videos and images involving children have flooded the Internet in the absence of a definitive regulation. The order also directs federal agencies to utilise developed tools to ensure that the public is aware that they have received authentic information from official sources. It promotes ethical use of AI by the military and intelligence community. The National Security Council and White House Chief of Staff will develop a National Security Memorandum for actions on AI and security to ensure that the military and intelligence community use AI safely, ethically, and effectively in their missions. Preserving privacy In the EO, the President addresses privacy concerns while acknowledging a limited ability to pass laws. The order urges the U.S. Congress to pass new data privacy laws to protect citizens, especially children. Directions include enhancing research and technologies that prioritise privacy, and framing guidelines for federal agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy norms in AI systems. Artificial intelligence's capabilities in these areas can increase the risk that personal data could be exploited and exposed. To combat this risk, the federal government will ensure that the collection, use, and retention of data is lawful, and secure, and mitigates privacy and confidentiality risks. Agencies shall use available policy and technical tools, including privacy-enhancing technologies where appropriate, to protect privacy and to combat the broader legal and societal risks â€” including the chilling of First Amendment rights â€” that result from the improper collection and use of people's data, reads the order. Fairness Besides privacy, there are also equity and civil rights at risk when it comes to AI. Mr. Biden acknowledged in his speech ahead of the signing that AI can lead to discrimination, bias and other abuses if the right safeguards are not in place. From hiring to housing to healthcare, we have seen what happens when AI use deepens discrimination and bias, rather than improving quality of life. Artificial intelligence systems deployed irresponsibly have reproduced and intensified existing inequities, caused new types of harmful discrimination,",positive,,EN,,,"1,87",INDIA,11225,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sci-tech/6rusci/article67520174.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Biden.jpeg,23598773,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,7079631,0,0,P00,,,P

CRC posts 26% gain in net profit over first 9 months PUBLISHED : 15 Nov 2023 at 08:00 NEWSPAPER SECTION: Business GO Wholesale, an all-inclusive food wholesale centre, plans to launch four branches in the final quarter of 2023. Central Retail Corporation (CRC) reported a 26% increase in net profit in the first nine months of this year, aiming to record a new high in the fourth quarter with the launch of the CRC Celebration of Happiness campaign. CRC posted a net profit of 5.25 billion baht, up 26%, on revenue of 183 billion baht, a gain of 7% in the first nine months of 2023. Yol Phokasub, chief executive of CRC, attributed the performance to its strong development of the retail and wholesale industry, both locally and overseas. In the third quarter, CRC's operations in Thailand posted a 6% increase in sales growth, helped by the fashion segment (8%) and home improvement materials at Thai Watsadu (12%). For operations in Vietnam, the company reported total revenue of 59.6 billion baht in the third quarter this year, an increase of 3%. Net profit fell marginally by 0.3% to 1.25 billion baht. Business development this year included the launch of GO Wholesale, an all-inclusive food wholesale centre, featuring four branches in the final quarter of 2023. In addition, the company plans to transform the Central Chidlom branch into the foremost luxury department store in Southeast Asia. CRC also allotted 500 million baht for the construction of a new building and expansion of the floor space to 23,000 square metres at Mega Bangna mall. The planned launch of Central Westville in western Bangkok, which is scheduled for Nov 29, brings the total number of Central Department Store branches in Thailand to 76. In European operations, Rinascente Italy posted a sustained surge in sales, registering 20% growth during the first nine months of this year. Mr Yol said this underscores the success of the renovations executed in various branches, catering to both local clientele and an escalating number of international visitors. In Vietnam, GO! Malls had 39 branches and registered an 18% increase in rental income during the first nine months of this year. GO! Hypermarket was the market leader for the segment in Vietnam, with 38 branches nationwide. The company plans to add four GO! Supermarket branches for a total of 10 by year-end, he said. Mr Yol said he is confident the company can set a new profit record in the fourth quarter, buoyed by the readiness of all business segments within the group. The company is set to launch the CRC Celebration of Happiness campaign, aiming to create excitement among shoppers and stimulate spending from both locals and tourists alike, he said.

Justice was was served here, Mr Bickle said soon after, outside the Toronto courthouse. We are dealing with a systemic monster who used his business talents for evil, to prey on others. The six-week trial had been the first time Mr Bickle had seen his father since a dinner party in 2019, where he says he saw Nygard inappropriately touch a girl. That's where Kai Nygard kind of died, said Mr Bickle, who has since assumed his mother's last name. The alleged incident was a shock to Mr Bickle, who said he had loved his father. I knew a different man, he told reporters. Since then, it's been a massive effort to seek justice. A lawyer for Nygard did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment regarding his son's accusation. He has previously denied all allegations against him. Nygard's stunning fall from grace - ending a decades-long career at the helm of a global fashion empire - has been publicly supported by Mr Bickle, who has spent the past four years cooperating with authorities and assisting those who say they were victims of his father's abuse. After the 2019 dinner party, Mr Bickle said he reported his father to an executive at Nygard's company, but was rebuffed and ridiculed, told by his father he was mentally unwell. I got a taste of what it was like to blow the whistle against a monster or a powerful predator, he said. Behind the scenes, Mr Bickle made contact with lawyers involved in a civil case against his father, he said, volunteering information to them and to investigators. And at Nygard's company, Mr Bickle said he slowed efforts to liquidate the corporation's assets, waging business battles to delay Nygard from moving them offshore. I blew the whistle in September of 2020, calling him out as a flight risk, Mr Bickle said, a move that finally revealed to his father that he was not on his side. That's when I was shut out from every point of contact. It's not a good association to be the son of the monster, he said. But I couldn't bear the thought of another person being harmed. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Peter Nygard seen in a police vehicle in Toronto after the guilty verdict His father's Toronto trial centred mostly on the testimony of five women, who testified they were lured by Nygard to a private luxury bedroom in his firm's Toronto headquarters and sexually assaulted. The complainants were between the ages of 16 and 28 during the attacks, which they said occurred between the 1980s and 2005. But Nygard - who was once estimated to be worth at least $700m (Â£570m) - has been accused of abuse by dozens of other women. He is still facing another trial in Montreal next year, and assault and confinement charges in Winnipeg. Once his criminal cases in Canada are completed, he is set to be extradited to the US, where authorities claim he engaged in a decades-long pattern of criminal conduct involving at least a dozen victims across the globe. He is currently fighting that extradition. And two of Mr Bickle's younger brothers have also launched lawsuits against Nygard, accusing their father of hiring a known sex worker when they were teens. Through representatives, Nygard has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing. There are so many survivors out there, this is their day, Mr Bickle said. A sentencing hearing will be set on 21 November.

Now victims of the prince's paedophile pal, Jeffrey Epstein , have accused the eighth in line to the throne of being dishonest over his claim to want to help them achieve justice. Spencer Kuvin, who represents multiple women abused by Wall Street financier Epstein, said: If Prince Andrew is innocent, he should provide a full interview to the FBI. His continued silence in the face of multiple close friends being convicted of sexual assault â€“ Ghislaine Maxwell and now Peter Nygard â€“ reeks of a guilty conscience.

It still unnerves me when I think about it. So, like I said, I worked in a nursing home. This one in particular had a lot of sickly patients - either extremely dependent old folk, or demntia/alzheimer ridden people. Each room had two beds, so they could have roomies or a couple could be together. If the family was really rich, they could have their own. Working there was unsettling enough, between hearing loud weeping and meeting residents who were like shells. It was an extremely sickly facility, and I knew it wasn't their fault, but being young I was easily unnerved. There was one lady in particular, though, who always kinda scared me (I was 19 and this was my first job, so I was a very nervous person). She had a room to herself, with lots of things, but I never saw her have company. I tried to make small talk with her to be friendly the first few times I cleaned her room or delivered her clothes, but she always ignored me or glared at me. So I stopped trying. One day, I arrive to her room to clean and I hear her talking. Like, full sentences, a full conversation, pauses and all. When I step in she glances at me long enough for me to give a quick smile before she looks away again, staring at the ceiling. I looked around, but there was no guest. I shrug it off as a quirk and got to work. A few moments pass and I hear her talking again. I didn't understand her though so I turned around politely and asked her, Were you talking to me, Miss [___]? She abruptly stopped and stared up at the ceiling, furious, and doesn't answer. I apologized softly and turned around to continue cleaning. Then she spoke again, and this time I understood her clearly. Sorry, about her. [Pause] No, I don't want you to kill her. I froze, midwipe, and felt chills go down my back. Surely, I misheard her. She continued on, saying, Because if you do, the nurses will be upset, and everyone will make a big fuss, and I dont feel like dealing with that right now. I don't remember anything but fear. I finished as fast as I could and got the fukj outta there. I found my supervisor and recounted the story hysterically, on the verge of quitting. She didn't believe me, thinking I was trying to get out early, and told me to take a break early. I took the time to calm down, and from that day on, I didn't spend more than a couple minutes in her room when I had to clean it. Every time I did though, she would be talking to someone I couldn't see. And I didn't dare interrupt her.",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,183,2,0,0,0,2,0,N,,,59470,r/TrueScaryStories,ghostlywostly,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,17841,0,0,P00,,,P

Pupils will receive details on collection arrangements from their schools, it added. If they are unable to collect their results at school, pupils can appoint a proxy to do so on their behalf by Nov 24. Eligible pupils will receive the S1 Option Form to select secondary schools with their PSLE results. Students are required to use their unique S1 personal identification number found on the top-right hand corner of the form to log in to the Secondary 1 Internet System to submit their school choices from 11.30am on Nov 22 to 3pm on Nov 28. Parents who need help with the online submission can contact the primary school before 3pm on Nov 28. Posting results will be released between Dec 20 and Dec 22 through SMS, the statement said. It can also be accessed through the Secondary 1 Internet System or at the pupil's primary school. Pupils do not need to report to their posted secondary schools upon receiving their S1 posting results, it added. Students who are eligible for Posting Group 1 or the Posting Group 1/2 Option Band, and are more inclined towards practice-oriented, hands-on learning, can apply to Crest Secondary School (CSS) and Spectra Secondary School (SSS). These schools offer a customised skills-based curriculum and exposure to unique learning opportunities, putting students in good stead for progression to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), said the statement said. Pupils can apply directly by submitting their school application to the respective schools starting from 11.30am on Nov 22 to 3pm on Nov 28. Application forms for these two schools are available at students' respective primary schools, or on the websites of CSS and SSS. Those who applied directly should continue to submit the S1 Option Form, in order to be posted to the school of their choice if they are not admitted to CSS or SSS. Those who applied directly and were successfully admitted into the specialised schools will be informed by Dec 13, and their other S1 school choices will be voided. Eligible pupils who did not apply directly to CSS or SSS but wish to be considered for admission to these schools can indicate CSS and SSS as one of their school choices in the S1 Option Form. The statement said: Students are encouraged to consider schools holistically when choosing a secondary school that would be a good fit for their educational needs, strengths and interests. It added that students are encouraged to visit the schools' open houses and explore their websites.

It loses the V6 in favor of hybrid inline-4 engines and, unlike the Honda Accord, offers all-wheel-drive. The 2025 Toyota Camry: Everything You Need to Know The all-new Camry has one popular feature its arch-rival Honda Accord lacks. Nov 15, 2023 Toyota The Camry has long been a mainstay in the Toyota lineup. It's America's best-selling non-truck or SUV by a wide margin . Indeed, it's so popular and common, it can seem ubiquitous â€” like the vanilla ice cream of cars. But hey, vanilla can be versatile in many different contexts â€” and offer a surprising depth of flavor. Well, there's a new variety of vanilla in town. Just ahead of the 2023 Los Angeles Auto Show , Toyota has unveiled the all-new 2025 Camry. We wouldn't call the ninth-generation model a radical departure from Camrys that have come before. But it does bring some substantial changes. And it's the first Camry model that won't be sold in Japan . Here's what you need to know about the 2025 Toyota Camry. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below There's only one Camry engine now, and it's a hybrid Toyota Pour one out for the Camry's 301-horsepower 3.5-liter V6. The 2025 Camry â€” at least at launch â€” only offers the 2.5-liter Toyota Hybrid System inline-four. It offers 225 horsepower in front-wheel-drive form and 232 horsepower in all-wheel-drive models. This is the first time the Camry has offered AWD on a hybrid sedan. The rival Honda Accord , which also favors hybrid engines in its most recent version, remains FWD-only. The Camry is sticking with the TNGA-K platform Toyota Technically, the Camry is not an all-new model; it's sticking with the same platform as the previous Camry. However, Toyota did make some significant tweaks to improve the driving experience. The new Camry has a re-engineered suspension and braking system. Toyota also says it tuned the hybrid engine to provide satisfying acceleration and torque feel. The 2025 Camry has a sportier new look Toyota Toyota made some aesthetic changes to the Camry to make it feel less like, well, buying a Camry. A new front fascia with standard slim LED headlights brings the Camry into the 2020s. Upper trims aim to look sportier (but not full-on Camry TRD ) with features like aerodynamic air ducts, a rear diffuser, a rear lip spoiler and an exposed dual-tip exhaust. You can also get a swanky two-tone paint job with a black roof and black multi-spoke alloy wheels. And Toyota is leveling up the Camry's interior Toyota Toyota spruced up the Camry's interior as well. Upper trims now sport Toyota's 12.3-inch infotainment display. The Camry incorporates an array of soft-touch materials, patterns on the doorsills and colors. Toyota made the seats more comfortable, lengthening the cushion and altering its shape density. Toyota softened the headrest and repositioned it farther back. Front acoustic laminated glass on the XSE trim can make it feel a bit quieter and Lexus-like . How much does the 2025 Toyota Camry cost? Toyota Toyota hasn't announced pricing for the 2025 Camry yet. But we don't expect it to be dramatically different from the current hybrid model, which starts at $28,885. The lineup should top out before the Crown , which starts at $40,050. When will the new Camry go on sale? Toyota Toyota says the Camry will go on sale in spring 2024 as a 2025 model-year vehicle.

Changing and using it is relatively painless, but it makes the console more... Comments TechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary. TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust . Why it matters: The recently unveiled slim model PlayStation 5 raised concerns due to the detachable disc drive's online activation requirement. A closer look reveals that switching the component is more straightforward than many might have anticipated. However, uncertainty remains regarding long-term physical media preservation. A teardown of Sony's new smaller PS5 model clarifies the optional disc drive's restrictions. Changing and using it is relatively painless, but it makes the console more reliant on an internet connection than the original variant. Photos of the PS5 Slim's packaging revealed the one-time online activation requirement last month. During his unboxing video for the console, which is now available, YouTuber Mystic (below) tested the detachable disc drive and discovered the conditions under which the DRM triggers. The good news is that the drive and its cover snap on and off without requiring a screwdriver. Furthermore, drives aren't permanently tied to the first console they register with. Instead, swapping units between PS5s repeats the quick one-time activation for each console. Factory resetting the system also repeats the process. Mystic also confirmed that physical games remain playable post-registration if the console is offline. Lending, borrowing, and replacing the optical drive is simple as long as users are online. The component is often the first to fail in game consoles, so making it detachable will likely lead to fewer replaced systems. A minor but welcome change is that the new model moves the eject button to the side of the disc tray, making it easier to distinguish from the power button. The front of the console also now features two USB-C ports instead of one, making it easier to connect and update two controllers. Unfortunately, however, all slim PS5s must register with Sony's servers to play game discs. The requirement includes units that ship with the Blu-Ray drive attached, suggesting that the company doesn't activate them in the factory. Earlier PS5 disc models can play offline games out of the box, meaning if someone digs one up in 20 years, it will theoretically be usable. The slim model, however, might become e-waste if it isn't registered and Sony's activation servers no longer exist. The company is likely voluntarily complying with DMCA requirements that attachable disc drives employ DRM to fight piracy and modding. However, there is no guarantee that hackers won't circumvent the system to allow things like third-party drives, out-of-the-box use, custom firmware, or disc ripping.

Sony's updated PS5 is smaller, lighter and has a tiny bit more storage, but the price keeps it from being a must-have upgrade. Nov. 14, 2023 12:17 p.m. PT 4 min read CNET Three years after launching the PlayStation 5, Sony has introduced a smaller PS5 model, commonly referred to as the PS5 Slim, but which is being sold under the old name. This isn't a new strategy -- the company used the same follow-on approach for the PS4, which also started out chunky and subsequently slimmed down. The PS5 Slim is available now , and Sony says the new versions will be the only option once it sells through its remaining stock of the old ones. I would keep an eye out for retailers trying to discount and move the older models if you're trying to find the cheapest option out there. Like the PS5 at launch, there are two versions of the Slim model, one with a disc drive and one without. Both now come with 1TB of storage instead of the 825GB that the original models had. Because that's the only change inside, don't expect any new components to make it faster or more powerful. Sony PlayStation 5 Slim (disc drive edition) $499 at Amazon The original PS5 launched at $400 for the Digital Edition and $500 for the one with a disc drive. Over the years, Sony actually increased that price in some places around the world, but US pricing did not change. The slim PS5 retails for $450 for the Digital Edition and $500 for the disc drive option, which is currently bundled with Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 for no extra cost. The biggest difference now is that the disc drive can be removed or added later. By lifting one of the cover plates, you can access the drive and pull it out. This feature is aimed more at players who buy the $450 discless version of the console, once again called the Digital Edition, since all the games will have to be digital versions as opposed to a physical disc. The model with the disc drive runs $500 -- if you want to add it later, you can buy the drive for $80. It's worth noting that the console requires an internet connection when first using it with a disc drive attached. Attaching (or detaching) the DVD drive. Sean Booker/CNET The original disc drive model stands 15.4 inches high, 10.2 inches deep and 4.1 inches wide. The Slim disc model stands 14.1 inches high, 8.5 inches deep and 3.8 inches wide. The original's weight of just under 10 pounds drops to just over 7 for the Slim. As someone who often travels and takes games consoles with me, having a smaller and lighter PS5 is fantastic -- I was never going to try and fit the enormous launch PS5 in my luggage. The original PS5 came bundled with a stand that could position the console either vertically or horizontally. However, Sony has only packed the Slim models with two tiny plastic feet to allow the console to sit horizontally. They're easy to attach by just pushing them into the little slots between the panels. I think this tripod setup looks kinda goofy. If you want to stand your slim PS5 upright, like I do, you'll need to buy the $30 vertical stand. By default you have to use it horizontally. To stand it vertically you have to get the optional feet. Sean Booker/CNET The front of the console has been slightly updated with two USB-C ports instead of one USB-C and one USB-A. The disc eject button below has been moved onto the drive itself, which makes sense since Sony's now selling these separately. The power lights have also been lengthened to go all the way down the front of the machine. The ports on the back are identical, although now they're positioned in a different order. PlayStation sells different color cover plates for the original PS5. It goes without saying that those will not fit on the new console. Sony has stated it plans to sell new versions for the Slim in early 2024 . The Slim comes with the same DualSense controller as before. The foot to stand the console vertically is sold separately. Sean Booker/CNET If you're in the market for the disc version, I recommend getting the Slim model. It has a bit more storage, and will take up less space on your shelf. Remember, if you stand your consoles upright, like I usually have to, you'll need that $30 vertical stand as well. When it comes to the Digital Edition, I'm having a hard time recommending the newer model. It's $50 more than the original, and if you change your mind about a disc drive later, you have to put out another $80, making it more expensive than the disc version to begin with. This means the digital version, which used to have a compelling lower price, just doesn't seem worth it if you're in the market for a PS5 right now. The smaller model (front) compared to the older one. Sean Booker/CNET For those of you who already have a PS5 and are thinking about upgrading, I recommend holding off and crossing your fingers for a Pro or more powerful model, if that ever happens. There just aren't enough differences between the two models, especially since both allow you to increase the internal storage on your own.

Corsair has unveiled its latest MP700 PRO Gen5 SSD lineup which comes with faster storage speeds & the option to go either air or liquid cooling. Corsair MP700 PRO Gen5 SSDs Feature Enhanced Cooling Options, Faster Transfer Speeds & Higher Prices The MP700 PRO is Corsair's 2nd Gen5 SSD lineup following the original MP700 SSD series which was released back in August. The newer PRO series comes with improved capabilities, with read and write speeds of up to 12,400 MB/s and 11,800 MB/s respectively. All MP700 PRO Gen5 SSDs are using the Phison E26 controller which is the fastest Gen5 SSD controller around and the PRO series offers up to a 75% speedup over the Gen4 drives. Related Story Silicon Power Unveils XS80 Gen5 NVMe SSD: Up To 10 GB/s Speeds, Passive Heatsink Currently, the Corsair MP700 PRO, Crucial T700 , and T-Force Z540 SSDs are on par with each other, featuring the same transfer speeds, and are the fastest in the industry. The random read-and-write speeds of the MP700 PRO are rated at 1.5 Million and 1.6 Million, which is also one of the fastest in the market. Coupled with high speeds along with support for Microsoft's DirectStorage, one should expect out of the world performance in real-time gaming. Boasting such high transfer speeds isn't something easy to do, and apart from the high-end components to achieve such milestones, a decent cooling solution is also required. To cater to this, Corsair has included their HYDRO X heatsink as well, which essentially slaps a waterblock on top of the heatsink. The heatsink can be paired custom loop as it uses two standard 1/4 fittings. For those who aren't water-cooling their PCs, you get an active-cooled heatsink too which features a big aluminum block that sits over the SSD. 2 of 9 In terms of pricing, the MP700 PRO is definitely not cheap, and it is justified given what the SSD has to offer to its potential consumers. The Corsair MP700 PRO 1TB & the 2TB Gen5 SSDs are available for $189.99 and $324.99 respectively (same price for Hydro X & Air-cooler variants). The heatsink-less variants cost $179.99 for 1 TB & $299.99 US for the 2 TB variant. It is expected that the MP700 PRO will also debut in a 4TB model, but that will be available in the upcoming months.

ICIJ-led investigation Cyprus Confidential reveals how the EU member state powered the Kremlin's financial machine, moving vast sums for oligarchs, including after Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion. OVERVIEW Cyprus ignores Russian atrocities, Western sanctions to shield vast wealth of Putin allies ICIJ-led investigation Cyprus Confidential reveals how the EU member state powered the Kremlin's financial machine, moving vast sums for oligarchs, including after Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion. Image: ICIJ / Ben King / Shutterstock November 14, 2023 Cyprus Confidential The Mediterranean island of Cyprus has long been a geopolitical crossroads, a prize contested by empires and a meeting point of peoples, religions â€” and money. An astonishing flood of foreign money, mostly Russian, has poured into the island over decades, bringing wealth to a few but leaving Cyprus with a reputation as a shady financial hub. Now, an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Paper Trail Media and 67 media partners reveals how Cyprus, at the east end of the Mediterranean nearest Turkey, Syria and Lebanon, plays an even bigger role than was commonly known in moving dirty money for Russian President Vladimir Putin's autocratic regime and other brutal dictators and anti-democratic actors. Among them: Syria's murderous rulers, whose state-owned oil company attempted to evade the United States' ban on doing business with it by using an intermediary on the island to disguise requests for purchases from a Houston oil equipment supplier; and Kremlin associates who channeled payments through Cyprus to a prominent German journalist known for producing fawning coverage of Russia's autocratic leader . The product of an eight-month investigation, Cyprus Confidential stories explore Russia's long-standing hegemony over Cyprus' deeply intertwined worlds of politics and finance. It explains how the mighty European Union has failed to exert authority over Cyprus, a European Union member state, or to rein in a banking system bloated by illicit money. It illustrates how, as Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Big Four accounting giant PwC's Cypriot unit helped Russian oligarchs shuffle their riches and undermine Western sanctions designed to cut off Putin's war funding. As Western nations have increasingly used financial sanctions to block the flow of money that other governments use for hostile purposes, Cyprus became a cloak-and-dagger financial battleground. The 3.6 million leaked files at the heart of the Cyprus Confidential investigation come from six financial services providers and a website company. The providers are: ConnectedSky, Cypcodirect, DJC Accountants, Kallias & Associates, MeritKapital, and MeritServus in Cyprus. The MeritServus and MeritKapital records were obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets. Leaked records from Cypcodirect, ConnectedSky and i-Cyprus were obtained by Paper Trail Media . In the case of Kallias & Associates, the documents were obtained from Distributed Denial of Secrets, which shared them with Paper Trail Media and ICIJ. DJC Accountants' records were obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets and shared by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project . The partner organizations shared all the leaked records in the project with ICIJ, which structured, stored and translated them from several languages before sharing them with journalists from around the world. Additional records came from Latvia-based Dataset SIA, which maintains the i-Cyprus website, through which it sells information about Cyprus companies, including Cyprus corporate registry documents. ICIJ assembled a team of more than 270 journalists from 54 countries and one territory and provided access to the leaked records through its secure document-research platform, Datashare. ICIJ and Paper Trail Media organized and coordinated the project through ICIJ's secure communications platform, I-Hub. As part of the Cyprus Confidential project, ICIJ's data and research team combed the records with partners to find sanctioned Russian oligarchs, billionaires and politically exposed persons (PEPs), and reveal their offshore holdings. The leaked internal records, dating from the mid-1990s to April 2022, include confidential background checks, organizational charts, financial statements, bank account applications and email messages. Together, the documents offer a penetrating look inside the rogue financial system that has helped empower some of the West's most determined foes. Critics say the island's dependence on Russian and other foreign money carried consequences only now being realized. When the Russians came to Cyprus, they brought not only Russian corruption, they brought Russian organized crime, they brought Russian agents of the Russian intelligence services, says Boris Demash, a Russian longtime resident of Cyprus and critic of Kremlin influence. Meanwhile, says Cyprus-based economic historian Alexander Apostolides, the island's politically wired professional firms seem to find ways to do the things that are either illegal or at least unethical. When the Russians came to Cyprus, they brought not only Russian corruption, they brought Russian organized crime, they brought Russian agents of the Russian intelligence services â€” Boris Demash, Kremlin critic In response to questions from ICIJ, a Cyprus government spokesperson said that, since 2013, Cyprus has engaged in persistent efforts and has managed to stabilize its banking sector and become a top jurisdiction for both anti-money laundering and sanctions enforcement. He said the country today has a strong and robust framework in place and our banking sector implements one of the strictest regulatory frameworks internationally, a view supported by a 2015 European Commission review of Cyprus' economy and financial sector, a 2022 review by the Council of Europe's main anti-money laundering advisory group, and several U.S. State Department assessments, including one last year that found the country's traditional banking sector is significantly less vulnerable to money laundering than it was just a few years ago. The spokesperson also said that Cyprus now places in the top 25% of international anti-money laundering enforcement rankings, while the banking system has been deleveraging significantly by reducing exposure to Russian deposits, which stood at only about 4% of total deposits at the end of 2021. Under the influence As Cyprus Confidential illustrates, shady finance has been the province of the highest levels of Cyprus' government and finance . The island's economic system, known as the Cyprus model, relies on an oversized financial sector with some of the European Union's weakest financial disclosure laws, an indulgent central bank â€” and a tsunami of more than $200 billion in Russian investment that has bought its oligarchs vast influence. Typifying the clannishness that has made it all possible is Nicos Anastasiades. A lawyer who founded a major offshore services practice that drew Russian clients, Anastasiades served as Cyprus' president from 2013 until early 2023. A 2019 investigation by ICIJ media partner OCCRP found that before Anastasiades took office, partners in his law firm served as officials of shell companies linked to massive suspected money laundering operations, including deals linked to Putin allies. Upon taking office, Anastasiades left the firm to two daughters and other partners and traveled to Moscow, where he met with Putin and secured agreements promoting closer economic and financial ties.

Trust is defined as the assured reliance or belief on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something (Webster's Dictionary). It's a term we use often to describe how we feel about the people, the institutions, and the things around us. But I would argue that the term trust was used differently years ago vs. how it is used and perceived today. Years ago, trust was binary. You either trusted someone or something, or you didn't. Today, that simplicity is blurred. We have half-truths. We have conditional truths. Our trust in the news we read, the information we gather, the products we use are laced with hope, and skepticism. It's a difficult world to navigate when it comes to trust. Trust in Data in Our Digital World One of the areas that has been impacted by this challenge is our data. Our trust in data was traditionally viewed through the lens of data quality. Data quality was either good or bad. Information was correct, or it was incorrect. It was easier then, perhaps, because data was simpler. The types of asset classes were (seemingly) finite. Information about these asset classes was relatively simple to measure. We had products, customers, transactions. But today, the types of data and the ways we collect it, measure it, and interpret it have dramatically increased. We live in a digital world now where everything we do and see is represented digitally. We have structured data and unstructured data. We have digitized our world such that our data today can describe symbols, images, opinions, sentiments, colors, and even feelings. And with this kaleidoscope of data comes a kaleidoscope of interpretations, shades of grey, and questions about the integrity of our information. A number of years ago, I was chatting with a very senior risk officer at a major financial institution. She explained to me how she was given the responsibility of gathering information from a number of the firm's operations and submitting that data to a scrutinous risk review. One day, she was called into the office of her boss â€” the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) â€” who asked about the data that she was using to calculate the risk positions of the firm. She told me that, when asked if she trusted the data she was using to calculate the firm's risk, she answered, Sort of. With downtrodden eyes, she recalled, That was not a good answer to give to your CRO. Data for Advanced Analytics Today, trust in the data we use is taking on an even greater consequence because of the advances in machine learning , artificial intelligence, and generative AI. While increasingly powerful, these technologies are also incredibly sensitive to anomalies in our data. Unintentional omissions or hints of biases in the data that feed our analytic engines can have an exaggerated impact on the outcome of these analyses. But the real challenge we face is our somewhat blind faith in the outcome of the analytics. Because these technologies are so powerful and can produce fantastic results, and because these technologies are becoming so ubiquitous to everything we do, we tend to simply trust the outcomes just because they came from an AI. We forget that the very nature of machine learning is that it learns. Although the initial data sets may be clean, new data is constantly flowing into our AI engines and if not careful, questionable data can skew future outcomes. At a recent EDM Council DataVision event, one of the panelists described this state of affairs by saying, Bad data with good analytics is worse than no analytics at all. If we cannot assure trust in the data feeding these powerful analytics, we risk, at a minimum, having to apologize, or at worse, making very bad decisions that impact our businesses, our environment, and people's lives. So, we are on the precipice of the perfect storm. We have an ever-increasing set of new asset classes, coming from new sources and channels, coupled with incredibly powerful technology. Putting this together, we need trust in the entire supply chain â€” from source to capture to storage to application. Although the challenge is multi-faceted, one way we can help improve this condition is through advanced and disciplined data management. Trusted Data Foundations to Manage Risk In January 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), on the heels of the 2008 Financial Crisis, issued the Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting. Referred to as BCBS239, the document (in summary) stated that in order to effectively manage financial risk, in addition to ensuring that your models are correct, you need accurate, timely, and trusted data. Ten years later, the essence of this paper still rings true. Trusted data is foundational. But as we have learned over the years, it is more than just data quality. Trusted data is the result of a disciplined manufacturing process that includes a series of capabilities from strategy and planning to well-defined business requirements, to advanced data architecture, and an adherence to a data governance framework that enables business through controlled access to quality data. Without this foundation, all AI/ML and analytics will be compromised. The EDM Council, in collaboration with industry experts, has been advocating this approach via the DCAM Â® â€” Data Management Capability Assessment Model â€” an approach that has been utilized across public and private industries. The executive that has been charged with driving this discipline is the chief data officer (CDO). In its early inception, the CDO's responsibilities centered around operational efficiency (fixing errors, correcting trade fails, cleaning customer data). Today, in addition to these responsibilities, the role of the CDO has dramatically expanded to include the critical capabilities needed to enable the successful use of a firm's information assets. CDOs focus on cloud adoption, data democratization, semantic modeling, data sharing, and responsible and ethical use of data, all of which are precursors for leveraging responsible and trusted AI/ML and advanced analytics. Trust is hard to achieve. There are many factors and many stakeholders needed to achieve this objective. When it comes to trust in our data and in our analytics, don't be blinded by the desire to chase after the shiny ball of AI/ML without remembering the basics.

Megan Fox opened up about suffering a miscarriage amid relationship with Machine Gun Kelly in 'Pretty Boys Are Poisonous.' Megan Fox has released a book of poetry, titled Pretty Boys Are Poisonous . Her poems delve into some of the most difficult experiences of the actress' life. Among these, Fox has written for the first time about a miscarriage she suffered, which fans believe occurred during her relationship with partner Machine Gun Kelly (AKA Colson Baker). There is an ultrasound by your side of the bed, 10 weeks and 1 day â€¦ do you think that if she could have, she would have left a suicide note? Fox wrote (via Page Six ). But now I have to say goodbye. I close my eyes and imagine holding you tight against my chest as they rip you from my insides. I will pay any price, tell me please, what is the ransom for her soul? People notes that Baker dedicated a performance to Fox at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards and added, And this is for our unborn child. However, this could have simply been referencing the couple's desire to have a child together, considering we don't know when the miscarriage happened. These poems were written in an attempt to excise the illness that had taken root in me because of my silence. I've spent my entire life keeping the secrets of men, my body aches from carrying the weight of their sins, Fox said in a statement, alluding to references to abusive relationships throughout the collection. My freedom lives in these pages, and I hope that my words can inspire others to take back their happiness and their identity by using their voice to illuminate what's been buried, but not forgotten, in the darkness. Fox and Baker have been dating since 2020, and have often referred to themselves as twin flames. They mutually proposed to each other in January 2022, and sparked breakup and cheating rumors in February 2023 , though their relationship now appears to be back on track.

Speaking at the 27th National Banking and Ethics Conference organised by the Chartered Institute of Bankers, the Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr. Ernest Addison, said the focus on professionalism and ethics being championed by the Institute inspires a lot of hope for the industry and Indeed, the importance of ethical behaviour in banking and financial markets has never been as relevant as it is today because of the moral and economic efficiency issues involved. 14 November 2023 7:59pm Dr Ernest Addison is the Governor of the Bank of Ghana. The Bank of Ghana has pointed out that the banking industry thrives on trust and the lack thereof threatens the stability and sustainability of the entire financial sector with adverse economic consequences. According to the Central Bank, any misconduct by industry players erodes public confidence and therefore proves detrimental to the entire sector, as was experienced few years ago. Speaking at the 27th National Banking and Ethics Conference organised by the Chartered Institute of Bankers, the Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr. Ernest Addison, said the focus on professionalism and ethics being championed by the Institute inspires a lot of hope for the industry and Indeed, the importance of ethical behaviour in banking and financial markets has never been as relevant as it is today because of the moral and economic efficiency issues involved. He explained that banks are indispensable to economic growth and, therefore, they should have moral obligations to safeguard financial integrity in the interest of depositors and shareholders, and the economy at large. The critical issues to focus on regarding the chosen theme include the ethical frameworks that guide banks policies and procedures, and the values that shape the actions of bankers, he stated. While the Bank of Ghana monitors proper ethical conduct among regulated institutions, it has also implemented its own internal Ethics and Compliance Programme. The objective is to entrench ethical culture among the Bank staff to model the culture and ethical behaviour expected from a regulator of the banking industry. The Governor said five years ago, the Bank established an Office of Ethics and Internal Investigations to strengthen good governance and promote the highest standards of ethical conduct commensurate with the Bank's mandate. Governor advocates for aggressive pursuit of ethical business He advocated for the relentless and aggressive pursuit of ethical business practice by all industry players. In doing this, we must adopt a collaborative approach, involving every individual in the institution, so that doing the right thing becomes embedded in the work culture. Each bank must aim to create a values-driven culture, agreed on by both the leader and leadership team, which should serve as a constant reference within the bank's systems and processes, he alluded. When the culture within the banking sector is values-based and values-driven, stakeholders, including depositors, would likely align their values to that of the bank. By that, a strong five ethical organizational culture supported by ethical decision-making and conduct would emerge and enhance professionalism within the industry, Dr. Addison added. He noted that the Banks, Specialised Deposit Taking Institutions, and PSPs Fraud reports issued by the Bank of Ghana annually give strong signals that the focus on ethics and ethical behaviour should be strengthened. He added that a single case of fraud, involving an employee of a bank or any financial institution, affects the whole industry and weakens public confidence in the industry.

1221913946,TORONTO.CTVNEWS.CA,11/14/2023,NEWS,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-to-ban-unpaid-restaurant-trial-shifts-1.6644085,Ontario to ban unpaid restaurant trial shifts | CTV News,"Ontario to ban unpaid restaurant trial shifts | CTV News Ontario is planning to explicitly ban unpaid trial shifts for restaurant and hospitality workers, while also strengthening rules against deducting employee wages in the event of customer theft. Ontario is planning to explicitly ban unpaid trial shifts for restaurant and hospitality workers, while also strengthening rules against deducting employee wages in the event of customer theft. Toronto Ontario to ban unpaid restaurant trial shifts Ontario is planning to explicitly ban unpaid trial shifts for restaurant and hospitality workers, while also strengthening rules against deducting employee wages in the event of customer theft. The latest proposed changes are set to be announced today by Labour Minister David Piccini ahead of legislation expected to be tabled this afternoon that contains a host of new labour laws. Piccini says that while it is already the law that employees must be paid for all hours worked, unpaid trial shifts are still happening as part of the interview process in some restaurants, so the practice will be specifically prohibited. Similarly, Piccini says labour laws already prohibit employers from deducting wages due to lost or stolen property, but new language will specifically ban it in instances of dine and dash or gas and dash. As well, while current laws permit employers to share in pooled tips if they are performing the same work as their staff, the legislation to be introduced today would require the employers to tell employees if they are doing that. Piccini says due to the rise of digital payment apps, including some that charge workers a fee to access their tips, the bill will also specify that employees who get paid their tips via direct deposit can choose where that money gets deposited. We're seeing apps that are taking a cut every time ... a worker accesses their tips and that's not acceptable, Piccini said in an interview. I mean, imagine telling an office worker they're going to get dinged every time they access their paycheques. We wouldn't say it's acceptable there, so why would we say it's acceptable for those in the hospitality and service sector? Other changes contained in the new legislation include several aimed at the recruiting and hiring process. The bill would ban employers from requiring Canadian work experience in job postings or application forms, something Piccini said will help newcomers get more of a foot in the door in order to offer their valuable skills and experience. Job postings would also be required to include salary ranges and businesses will have to disclose whether artificial intelligence is part of their hiring process, in part due to concerns about data collection and personal privacy. The legislation would also boost payments to injured workers by enabling increases to Workplace Safety and Insurance Board benefits to be super indexed to a rate above inflation. As well, it would allow more firefighters and fire investigators to qualify for WSIB benefits due to esophageal cancer. Currently, firefighters and fire investigators have to have been on the job for 25 years before esophageal cancer would be considered a work-related illness. The new legislation would also increase the number of international students in Ontario eligible for the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program by revising eligibility requirements to allow students from one-year college graduate certificate programs to apply. As well, it would change how regulated professions such as accounting, architecture and geoscience use third-party organizations to assess international qualifications, which the government says would improve oversight and accountability.

The Chief Executive of Selina Beb Designs, Selina Bebaako-Mensah, has averred that she obtained the inspiration to pursue a law degree in the United Kingdom from one of Ghana's most prominent media personalities, Kwaku Sintim-Misa, aka KSM. Source: Comfort Ann Tettey-Tawiah 14 November 2023 8:37pm The Chief Executive of Selina Beb Designs, Selina Bebaako-Mensah says she was inspired to pursue a law degree in the United Kingdom by one of Ghana's most prominent media personalities, Kwaku Sintim-Misa, aka KSM. Speaking on Joy Learning TV's â€˜The Career Trail', the fashion mogul said the idea of pursuing law originally came from her father, however, upon completion of high school, she toyed with the idea of exploring different career paths because she was not quite sure what she wanted to do in the future. In secondary school, I decided not to do Science because I wasn't very good at it, and because I didn't think I could become a good doctor. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do, so I remember I kept toying with a few things. I was considering Journalism, or maybe pursuing Business Administration at the university. One of the things that fascinated me at that young age was Interior Design. I remember toying with the idea of becoming an Interior Designer as well, she said. Selina recalls admiring Oprah Winfrey a lot, and had dreams of becoming like her someday. Her dilemma over the choice of a career path prompted her father to suggest the idea of a Law Degree. For him, Law was a good stepping stone to branch into other fields such as Journalism, since she appeared to possess a perceptible endearment towards engaging people and operating in the field of Journalism. He said, you know, you like talking, you like arguments, so I feel like you would be a good lawyer. And then I thought about it, and I was like okay. That wasn't my interest â€“ law never crossed my mind, I never dreamt to become a lawyer, but I thought okay, law is prestigious, she said. At the time, she recalled, KSM used to have a talk show on career guidance and development so she sought his opinion. So one day, I wrote to him at Vibe FM. I remember I visited Vibe FM a few times to meet him. So I remember I spoke to KSM, and KSM said if your father wants you to do law, I think you should go ahead and do it, she explained. In the end, she agreed to pursue a law degree and relocated to the UK at the age of 18. However, she said things did not go as planned. So I moved to England a year after completing secondary school. I attended Anglia Ruskin University, and that's in Essex in the UK. And, uh, I hated it. It was difficult and it was a lot of reading. I don't really like reading, I prefer to either listen or to talk. So yeah, instead of maybe even reading a book, I prefer to listen to its audio version. So reading all those thick law books, oh my God, just the size of the law books alone used to scare me. For every lecture, there was a tutorial, and honestly, I didn't like it. I was quite young as well. I was immature, and I wasn't concentrating on my studies. To cut a long story short, I messed up my law degree, she revealed. As expected, her father was very disappointed at the wasted prospect of his daughter turning out to be a refined lawyer after all. Therefore, in retaliation, he instructed her not to return to Ghana but rather, to remain in the UK and to hustle. Selina, nonetheless, still had dreams of returning to school. However, those dreams had to be fully funded by herself. So I did odd jobs, especially with retail companies. I worked with Marks & Spencer, which is one of the oldest retail companies in England. So I worked with three different branches, she recalled. For her, even though her initial dream of pursuing law did not fully materialise, she still had the opportunity to build the much-needed experience and skill in the retail and fashion industry in the UK, which have proven to be very instrumental in her professional life today.

Right to Housing / Diritto alla casa . Although the Right to Housing is recognized in numerous international treaties, including Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the shortage of adequate housing is one of the most urgent problems that humanity must and will have to face in the coming years, starting from a reconsideration of the distribution model of available public expenditure, which generally envisages lower spending on housing compared to other areas.

Pep Guardiola has no complaints about being forced to name an incomplete substitutes bench that incl... Pep Guardiola not concerned that Manchester City only had eight subs at Chelsea By Sports Desk November 13, 2023 Email Pep Guardiola has no complaints about being forced to name an incomplete substitutes bench that included two goalkeepers during Manchester City's dramatic 4-4 draw with Chelsea on Sunday. The champions took only eight replacements to Stamford Bridge, amongst them reserve keepers Stefan Ortega and Scott Carson, as injuries limited the manager's options. Guardiola was without John Stones and Nathan Ake, with the latter having been ruled out as late as Friday, whilst Kevin De Bruyne remains a long-term absentee. Yet City looked to have coped well without their missing trio and thought they had nicked three points late on in west London when Rodri's effort deflected in off Chelsea's Thiago Silva four minutes from time. That was until former City man Cole Palmer levelled from the spot in the fifth minute of stoppage time after Armando Broja had been fouled by Ruben Dias. Despite the enforced absences and dropped points, Guardiola said he was satisfied with the squad depth available to him. Kevin is long-term, John was injured unfortunately. Nathan was injured. The rest are OK, he said. I like to work with a small (group). It's so tough if five, six, seven players don't play, they don't like that. It's what it is. If we have injuries, it's unlucky, but we have done all the time. For many years we've had this type of squad. Guardiola said he felt his team put in a performance far better than in recent seasons at Stamford Bridge, despite Palmer â€“ who left City for Chelsea in a Â£42million deal on the last day of the transfer window â€“ coming back to haunt his former manager at the death. It came after the visitors has twice led through Erling Haaland, who scored his 12th and 13th Premier League goals of the season, with Manuel Akanji also netting. For Chelsea, Raheem Sterling also scored against the club with whom he won the league four times, with Silva and Nicolas Jackson also on target. I don't remember a game where we've come here and had the chances that we had, said Guardiola. Even games where we've come here and won, last year for example was much, much worse than (Sunday). Even by a million times it was much worse than today, and we won 1-0. We tried, we created a lot of chances. The talent cannot be controlled sometimes. They are in a good process, their shape is really good, what they do. Give credit both teams. The game was tight. It was momentum for everyone, and momentum you can break. It's a fair result. Nothing changed. Chelsea is Chelsea, one of the greatest teams in the last 20 years. I know how good they are. For us, it's a good test. How long we didn't lose, that's a good sign. Today we didn't lose, we (played) away. We take a good point, we created a lot of chances in the right moments. I think it was a fair result for both sides. Manchester City acknowledge risk of charges after posting record Â£712m revenue Manchester City have acknowledged the Premier League charges facing them risk having a material impact on the club, as they posted a league-record revenue figure of over Â£700million. City earned Â£712.8m in the year ending June 30, an increase of almost Â£100m compared to the previous year and far outstripping the Â£648.4m Premier League record set by Manchester United when their most recent results were announced last month. City's run to the Champions League final â€“ where they beat Inter Milan 1-0 in June â€“ contributed to total broadcast revenue of Â£341.4m, including Â£113.85m just from UEFA. However, the club's annual report mentioned the 115 charges issued against them by the Premier League in February under the â€˜Risks and Uncertainties' section. The board acknowledges that there are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the club's performance, the report stated. As well as the Premier League charges, the performance of the first team and any future regulatory changes introduced by the Premier League, the Football Association, UEFA and FIFA were also cited as risks and uncertainties facing the club. Introductory statements in the annual report from chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and chief executive Ferran Soriano made no reference to the charges. Khaldoon said: In the aftermath of the UEFA Champions League win in Turkey and the completion of â€˜The Treble' the question I was asked most often, was â€˜How do you top that?' The answer is by doubling down on the proven philosophies and practices that have brought us this success and to challenge ourselves to continue to constantly innovate in order to achieve new levels of performance both on and off the field. We will continue to question all the industry norms, we will evaluate our successes and learn from any failures. We will not be afraid to set new goals and develop new strategies that deliver for our club, its communities and stakeholders and especially for the fans. Matchday revenue was recorded at Â£71.9m, while profit from player trading was up to over Â£120m. However, the club's total payroll costs were just under Â£423m, up from just under Â£354m in 2022. That was despite head count dropping from 549 to 520. Garvey Maceo and Dinthill Technical join Clarendon College and Glenmuir in DaCosta Cup semis 2021 champions Garvey Maceo and Dinthill Technical both secured their spots in the semi-finals of the ISSA/Wata DaCosta Cup on Tuesday. Garvey Maceo booked their passage through to the last four with a 2-0 win over Cornwall College at Glenmuir. The first few minutes of the contest saw both teams playing some untidy football. Garvey Maceo was first to register a shot on target through Jelani Williams in the sixth minute. The 2021 champions continued to apply early pressure before it was finally rewarded through a brilliant individual goal from Williams in the 10th minute. He picked up the ball from just outside the half-way line and dribbled past three players before slotting the ball home past the Cornwall College goalkeeper for his 11th goal of the season. Cleo Clarke almost made it 2-0 for Garvey Maceo in the 30th minute but his close-range shot only found the side netting. Cornwall's best chance of the first half came in the 33rd minute when Lincoln Cox found himself free for a header from a corner that he put wide of the mark. Three minutes into the second half, Garvey Maceo doubled their lead through Cleo Clark's 20th goal of the season. After an Everton Swaby shot was parried well by the Cornwall College goalkeeper, the ball ricocheted to Clark who finished well with his weaker right foot. Swaby almost added a third for Garvey Maceo in the 62nd minute but pushed his shot wide of the goal. Dane Buckley almost pulled one back in spectacular fashion for Cornwall College with a volley that went just over the bar in the 65th minute. He also came close in the 67th minute. Garvey Maceo advanced second place with six points, the same as Dinthill Technical, and will take on Clarendon College in the semi-finals. Clarendon College secured top spot on group A with a 2-1 win over Glenmuir at Manchester High. Dinthill will face Glenmuir in the other semi-final. The day's other game saw Manchester beat Christiana 2-0 at Brooks Park. Grimsby ease past Slough with convincing second-half display Grimsby fought through an end-to-end first half to beat sixth-tier Slough 7-2 in their FA Cup first-round replay at Blundell Park. The Mariners opened the scoring in the seventh minute as Arthur Gnahoua's deflected effort on the edge of the Slough area fell to Rekeil Pyke to finish neatly. Slough went two down in the 16th minute, with Danny Rose diving in to finish off a corner that was flicked on at the near post.

Het is de Fortuny lamp van Palluccco vernoemd naar de ontwerper Mariano Fortuny die deze vloerlamp in 1985 ontwikkelde. Gefascineerd door podia en theater verlichting experimenteerde meneer Fortuny met indirect licht. Het onderstel refereert aan een camera statief terwijl de kap u denkbeeldig direct naar het theater brengt. Naast dat deze vloerlamp mooi en helder indirect licht geeft is het ook een prachtig item die een statement maakt in elke woning. Regelmatig laten wij nieuwe dingen zien in de showroom wat betekend dat andere meubelen hiervoor plaats moeten maken. Daarom zijn wij opzoek naar een nieuwe plek voor deze lamp en word het showroom model voor een scherpe prijs verkocht.

The system allows businesses to make use of generative artificial intelligence technology for a variety of purposes, including searches and conversations. OSN+ plans to use Vertex AI Search for Media Recommendations, a next-generation large language model, to enhance content discovery and viewing recommendations. The aim is to redefine the way users interact with our platform, making it more engaging and dynamic, said Joe Kawkabani, the CEO of OSN Group. Tarek Khalil, Google Cloud's director for the Middle East and North Africa, added that the Vertex AI system will benefit consumers who want assistance in discovering relevant content in a highly personalized and conversational way. Once the technology is integrated, the companies said, users will be able to interact with a virtual assistant that will provide more accurate, personalized recommendations. The AI collaboration, announced during the annual Google Media Summit last week, is the first of its kind between the tech giant and an entertainment streaming platform in the Middle East and North Africa region. Follow Saudi Fund for Development and Broadcasting Authority sign agreement for enhanced cooperation The authority will provide coverage and documentation of projects financed by the fund in developing nations, and the organizations will exchange knowledge and data The agreement was signed by Mohammed Fahad Al-Harthi, head of the broadcasting authority, and Sultan Al-Murshid, CEO of the development fund Updated 15 November 2023 Arab News November 15, 2023 01:13 RIYADH: The Saudi Fund for Development and the Saudi Broadcasting Authority on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance cooperation in a number fields. Under the agreement, the broadcasting authority will provide media coverage and documentation for development projects financed by the fund in developing nations. The organizations will also exchange knowledge and data, and organize joint training courses. The agreement was signed by Mohammed Fahad Al-Harthi, the head of the broadcasting authority, and Sultan Al-Murshid, the CEO of the development fund, Al-Ekhbariya TV news channel reported. Al-Murshid said that the organizations were already working together before the agreement was signed to publicize the work of the development fund in beneficiary countries. Al-Harthi said: We are proud of this partnership with the SFD, which is in line with our policy to build partnerships with bodies whose work complements ours. He also highlighted comments by Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, head of Saudi aid agency KSrelief, who said in December 2022 that the Kingdom ranked first among global donor states in terms of development assistance, based on figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The huge and diverse range of development projects the fund has been involved with include the construction of hospitals in more than 100 countries around the world, Al-Harthi said. This reflects the true image of Saudi Arabia, which provides humanitarian aid and supports (other nations), he added, and his organization wants to help reveal this image to the rest of the world. Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Economy and Planning said in September that the Kingdom has contributed more than $87 billion in international aid to help support development projects and combat poverty. Experts call on governments, media to unite in global effort to tackle climate change CNN Business Arabic chief highlights at global industry conference importance of media in promoting message Representatives from China, Serbia, Costa Rica share knowledge at Global Media Congress ahead of COP28 Updated 14 November 2023 GABRIELE MALVISI November 14, 2023 20:43 LONDON: The vital role of governments and the media in highlighting the world's climate change crisis was becoming paramount, experts told the Global Media Congress on Tuesday. On the sidelines of the opening day dedicated to media and sustainability, Mustafa Al-Rawi, the acting managing director at CNN Business Arabic, discussed the importance of collaboration in promoting the message of climate change to a wider audience. He said: The government needs the media, and the private sector and activists need media to really take an interest in the story. Al-Rawi noted that particularly post-coronavirus pandemic, rising prices and inflation had shifted attention away from the issue. Raising awareness and helping to communicate what needs to be done (within the climate change realm) is going to be an ongoing journey, particularly because we're looking medium and long term, he added. The panel discussion session, titled Government communication tools for sensitizing audiences on climate change: views and experiences, brought together representatives from Costa Rica, Serbia, and China to share their insights and experiences in navigating the complex subject. H.E. Wang Yibiao, deputy editor-in-chief of China's People's Daily newspaper, pointed out the transformative power of media in shaping public perception. Echoing the words of the UAE's Minister of Tolerance and Coexistence Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al-Nahyan, Yibiao highlighted the importance of leadership and strategic planning in addressing climate challenges. He called for proper reporting and better quality of work that showcased positive actions that inspired resilience. Media adviser to Serbia's president, Suzana Vasiljevic, noted that by incentivizing citizens to adopt eco-friendly practices and engaging the media, Serbia had successfully raised awareness and empowered its people to take the initiative in proposing solutions. She said that a strong media delegation from the Balkan country was set to attend the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, starting later this month, to serve as both the source and conduit. The responsibility of the media to transmit a very important message was also highlighted by Costa Rica's Minister of Communications Jorge Rodriguez Vives, who spoke of the Central American country's success in environmental conservation. He said Costa Rica's investment in people, culture, and robust environmental policies, supported by media coverage, resulted in a significant reduction in deforestation and success in conveying the government's commitment to susta",positive,,EN,,,"6,3",UNKNOWN,131,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2023/11/15/4095681-348373939.png?itok=rpeO8jDQ,5000,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1500,0,0,P00,,,P

(OJ Koloti, Gallo Images) The National Student Financial Scheme (NSFAS) has refuted claims by the South African Union of Students (SAUS) that it is on the brink of collapse, arguing that it is realigning and modernising to meet the demands of the more than 1 million students it serves. In a statement, the union said NSFAS was near collapse and had failed to pay over 70 000 students their monthly allowances since the end of May, after it switched to a direct payment system. These are students of poor and working-class background. This enormous failure of NSFAS in upholding its mandate to service them with excellence and dignity has exponential consequences, SAUS said. This will subsequently lead to their academic and financial exclusion, further plunging the poor and working class into abject poverty with no prospects of alleviating themselves from the clutches of poverty. In response, NSFAS said it was reviewing all the processes and operations of its allowances models and had hired a new cadre of employees to implement the student-centred model, in which the direct payment system is a key component. However, SAUS said the non-payment of student allowances was an indication that the financial aid scheme was not ready for the 2024 intake, underlined by the fact that it had failed to open applications on 15 October. This undoubtedly is not only a cause for concern but a crisis because it guarantees us that NSFAS will most definitely not be ready for the start of the academic year 2024, further plunging the sector into instability and a crisis, SAUS president Yandisa Ndzoyiya said. In a letter dated 4 November, Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Blade Nzimande gave the NSFAS board three weeks to submit a comprehensive report on its service delivery. The minister's letter follows an investigation by Werksmans Attorneys into irregularities, poor governance and mismanagement at the financial scheme after thousands of students were left stranded due to non-payment of their stipends. This must inevitably include close monitoring of the very important service delivery aspects, which include the timeous payment of student allowances, as well as the continued accreditation of student accommodation, said Nzimande. In October, NSFAS axed its CEO Andile Nongogo over allegations of corruption, fraud and illegal tender dealings after a forensic report by Werksmans alleged he had a relationship with one of the companies appointed for the new direct payment system. Nongogo, in turn, has implicated NSFAS chairperson Ernest Khosa in some of the alleged dodgy activities, saying that during his suspension, his electronic signature was used without his authorisation to issue student accommodation off-take and 12 agreement letters were sent to potential service providers. Khosa has denied the allegations. Meanwhile, the former CEO has approached the labour court in Braamfontein In an attempt to get his job back, claiming that his employment was terminated in breach of his contract. Reinstatement is the only remedy that would ensure that the material provisions of my employment contract are honoured, Nongogo said. SAUS has given the minister 14 days to act against the inability of the board to provide effective oversight in ensuring that NSFAS upholds its mandate and to ensure that the NSFAS 2024 applications are opened.

Border guards from the newly established Border Management Authority (BMA) have arrested two people and charged them with the possession of stolen goods, including street lights, that they were attempting to take into Mozambique. The Border Management Authority said the pair was arrested by border guards at the Kosi Bay port of entry when they intercepted state property which was en route to Mozambique on Saturday, 11 November. The state property included 52 street lights worth R1.9 million belonging to the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality. The BMA on Monday said the two men were in a grey Isuzu bakkie which was driven by a Mozambican national when they were searched at the port of entry bordering South Africa and Mozambique. The team immediately activated the Hawks and Durban metro police. Two Mozambicans were arrested and charged with the possession of stolen goods, including damaging of essential infrastructure, the BMA said. In addition, the BMA said the vehicle they were travelling in as well as the property were seized and handed over to the Manguzi South African Police Service (SAPS). A case was opened and handed over to the Hawks for further investigation. Directorate for priority crime investigation (Hawks) spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Simphiwe Mhlongo said on Saturday Hawks members from Richards Bay Serious Organised Crime Investigation working together with the Kosi Bay Border Management Authority were conducting a joint operation at the Kosi Bay Port of Entry when they stopped a vehicle, coming from South Africa to Mozambique, that was pulling a trailer. A search was conducted and 52 LED street lights engraved as property of eThekwini Municipality were found. Suspects could not give reasonable explanation on how they obtained the municipality property, he said. The eThekwini Municipality said it is concerned that cross-border crime syndicates are now targeting the municipality, which could have a detrimental impact on service delivery. BMA Commissioner, Dr Michael Masiapato, commended the remarkable work of the border guards in preventing illegal activities and securing the state assets. The BMA border guards serve as the first line of defence working around the clock to enforce immigration laws thereby maintaining the integrity of our nation. Their vigilance in this incident and dedication contribute significantly to maintaining law and order. Their operation in intercepting municipal assets is truly commendable, said Masiapato. In July last year Masiapato's BMA deployed its first cohort of 221 border guards at what was called vulnerable segments of the borderline, including informal community crossing points. The BMA is looking to add 400 more border guards, of which 50 will be coast guards. Their recruitment, government news agency SAnews reported, will ensure the entity is effective and efficient at all border posts. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the BMA in the Limpopo border town of Musina, close to the Beitbridge port of entry, on 5 October. According to Masiapato, the BMA aims to ensure that South African borders are less porous and more efficient in facilitation of trade as well as ensuring the legitimate movement of goods and people. South Africa has 72 ports of entry, 53 of which are land-based, 10 are aviation or international airports and nine maritime. Over and above managing the 72 ports of entry, we are managing the vulnerable segments of our border lines and community crossing points, he is reported as saying. Masiapato mentioned that to assist with technological support on border management operations, the Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, recently announced the issuing of a Request for Proposals (RFP) to the market for the redesigning and redevelopment of South Africa's top six busiest ports of entry. The re-developed ports of entry will result in the efficient cross-border management of movement of people, goods and services, improved revenue collection and preventing harmful imports and exports, he stated. The six earmarked ports of entry are Beitbridge (Zimbabwe), Lebombo (Mozambique), Maseru Bridge (Lesotho), Ficksburg (Lesotho), Kopfontein (Botswana), and Oshoek (Eswatini). These ports were earmarked in order to address the congestion, based on being the largest and busiest by traffic volume. The re-designing project is expected to create an estimated 38 000 jobs in areas around the six designated ports of entry. The BMA was formally established as a Schedule 3(A) public entity on 1 April 2023, allowing Ramaphosa to launch it as Commander-in-Chief of the SANDF in October. Masiapato said the previous multi-departmental approach in place for the past 29 years was a major challenge, where a number of Departments were operating at the borders. You had the Department of Home Affairs doing immigration; the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment doing biosecurity functions, the Department of Agriculture doing agriculture functions and also the Department of Health responsible for port health functions. In the previous years we had independent managers of those four departments operating at the ports and reporting back to their various departments. This was over and above the operations of the South African Revenue Services (SARS) facilitating port customs, the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and the South African Police Service (SAPS) responsible for border policing functions. The new model integrates the port functions of the four departments. In order to empower the BMA to be effective, it was then created as a law enforcement authority, which became the third armed service in South Africa after SANDF and SAPS. The SANDF will continue to have 15 companies of soldiers deployed along the borderlines under Operation Corona.

Upon moving in things happened quickly we found a house for $1200/month ($600 each) and moved in immediately. She asked me what room I wanted but before I could even answer she chose the much larger room and left me with the really small one. Sam and I worked together and graduated from the same uni, I considered her a really good friend so I was excited. I soon discovered she ate her pimples and kept the litter box in her room even though I didn't mind if it was in a common room with more windows so her room smelled awful 24/7. I had to travel for work one week and when I returned the bathroom smelled like rotten eggs and hot garbage. I discovered she left a rotting tampon in the garbage. I asked her to clean the bathroom and to her credit she did. The house had this massive shower without a tub, there were hairs clogging the drain, pubic, leg, you name it so I had to use a hanger on more than one occasion. After my trip I was extremely broke because I had to use my own money for travel, hotel, and food during this trip (the company would repay me a few days later) so I was going to be late on rent by one day. I had already spoken with the landlord and let Sam know that she was totally fine with it as it'd only be one day late but she became inconsolable and wanted to everyone in our office who were equally poor graduates and assured her it wouldn't affect anything as I had already spoken to the landlord. I got sick of her crying and embarrassment that I had to borrow from my dad and promptly repaid him a day later. She invited our colleague who I was interested in to move in with us, by move in, she meant sleeping on the couch. He did. Without asking meâ€¦ that was uncomfortable for both of us. She would consistently harass my dog and treat him like an ugly step child even though he loved her cat and was really gentle. She'd pull his leash so he'd cry when I wasn't looking. I finally threatened to report her for animal abuse. I had to put a mini camera from one of those gadget stores to find out why my clothes went missing even though she never wore them. I discovered she'd take it into her room so one day I stood by her door and acted as though I wanted to chat. What I discovered was a fever dreamâ€¦ she had been lining her cat litter box with my clothes, including a $400 down jacket my parents gifted me for graduation (Italy trip). She once screamed from the kitchen, I ran in a panic to make sure she hadn't cut herself while cooking only to discover she had been counting her grapes and thought I had stolen a single grape. She dropped to the floor and found it under the fridge, but not before calling me a thief. I haven't had a roommate since. She also started a rumor that I cheated on my thesis, that was debunked and that I had a child out of wedlock when I did not.",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,378,41,0,0,0,41,0,N,,,143712,r/badroommates,Farrahlikefawcett2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,43113,0,0,P00,,,P

A failure for livings with my parents at 25? And if so, what can i do to change that? This post is going to be long, and I apologise, but i would greatly appreciate any feedback since I've been thinking about this for the past few days and it keeps bothering me to the point i cannot concentrate at work. I have to preface this with a brief history. I am 25, my parents are 51 and 49. Growing up they have always been the I'm preparing you for the real world type of parents. Beatings (getting locked in the room and beaten with a belt or hands wasn't uncommon), silent treatment wasn't uncommon, all that jazz. There rarely were explanations and often times most questions where answered with because i say so. While other times everything was going seemingly well. It was, and still is, the type of explosive household where you never knew what could happen or set off their temper. Both my parents are like this. As a result i grew resentful towards them, and have developed problems i have been working on since i was sixteen. (Anxiety, difficulties relaxing, binge eating etc) When i got to my teens (mainly 16/17) i became very argumentative, because i say so wasn't an answer i was willing to accept and i had to argue about it until they started to either beat me or scream at me/tell me i should just move out. It wasn't all bad of course, when I didn't have an income there was food at home and i had what i needed. But when it was bad, it was very bad. I have my faults, i spend as little time as possible at home, so sometimes I'll leave clothes to dry for two days and they'll have to remind me to take them off the drying rack. When i cook I don't clean right away, I usually cook, put the things i used aside/in the sink, eat, take 15/30 mins of just looking at nothing and then i go back at it and clean what i used. Sometimes I'll forget a spot, which is a mistake and I'm trying to be careful about it, but it ends up with them screaming and threatening me. Skip forward to now, even while working on it with a psychiatrist, i still carry a lot of resentment towards them, and while the beatings have stopped (i go to a gym and i became taller and bigger than my dad) the screaming, the threatening and the verbal abuse never did. My mother often picks fights with me about the most random nonsense (like she didn't want me to train the dog to not bark at every small sound outside) and when i reply and explain myself, she tells me to stop bothering her, even though she started the discussion. Which leads to a fight, she complains to my dad about how I'm a horrible son and i get screams and threats from him too. My girlfriend witnessed this and so did my aunt, my cousin and my some friends. All of them didn't understand why my parents act the way they do. About two weeks ago my mom told me she'd wish i just moved out so she would never have to see me again, while my father told me I'm a loser and it's extremely sad that I'm still living with them at 25 (i said it was sad seeing that everything came down to screaming in our house and he replied with that, after telling me you know what's sad?) and he blamed me for him not having any savings at 50. Yes, i still live with them. I work as an accountant and still live with them. I do so simply because life in italy, in the region i live in, is not sustainable for a single person on a 1500â‚¬/month salary. I am waiting for my gf (8yr relationship) to finish college (a few months still) and we'll move in together, since most owners want at least a 4yr contract and two incomes to rent you an apartment. I do not touch their food, i pay for everything i eat, I'm paying my car, I'm paying gas for my car, I'm paying for all the expenses i have. I shower at the gym most of the time and i try to be at home as little as possible, and when i am I'm in my room. I do use the kitchen and the bathroom (+1 washing machine load per week). But there's a big flaw in how i behave at home. I'll rarely ever help with chores. I do take out the trash, help with our dog, but I don't wash the floors, the bathroom, the kitchen (unless I've used them and made them dirty, in which case I'll clean it) and I'm trying to change that, but it's hard, I'm just so resentful towards them that it's hard to clean for them, especially since I'll get screamed at if I place bowls and dishes in a way my mother doesn't want them to be in, or if i put in the dishwasher dish's washer safe cookware that my mother does not want to be washed in the dishwasher for some reason. And no, i do not pay rent. Am i bad son? A failure for still living with them at 25? How can i change how i feel about them? I tried talking openly to them about this and even offered them to go to my therapist with me. They refused. If you need any other info, please ask away and i'll answer/edit the post, it's a topic that i have difficulties talking about so i could have forgot something. And i mainly remember bad episodes from my childhood, like when my dad used to find candy wrappers and chips hidden in my room (binge eating) he would lock himself in my room with me and beat me with a belt or with his hands. Sadly I don't recall a lot of my childhood other then these things. Edit: just for clarification, i am not a dick to anyone. I'm always willing to help and i'm happy to do so, unless it's my parents asking it ",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,482,2,0,0,0,2,0,N,,,192224,r/AskParents,ConfusoMaTanto,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,57667,0,0,P00,,,P

(Translated by Google Translate App.) If we do good according to the provisions of Allah & the Prophet Muhammad shollalaahu 'alaihi wasalaam, then that kindness, who knows when, will return to us in the form of pleasures and if we do good to someone, it could be that the reward for that kindness is not from the person we have given kindness to. . The reward for kindness for Muslims is given in this world & the hereafter, while the reward for kindness for non-Muslims is only in this world. Disaster is a test for Muslims whose sins have been forgiven by Allah. Disaster is a warning for Muslims who want to repent. Disaster is a punishment for Muslims and non-Muslims who do not want to repent. The repentance of non-Muslims is to convert to Islam and carry out its teachings. Sins must be paid for with repentance, forgiveness, good deeds or calamities that affect the perpetrator himself, his children or his wife. Taqwa Muslims are also still being tested with calamities. If the burden of sin in an area is greater than the reward of its inhabitants, it is likely that the area will be hit by a disaster. Here are examples of major sins: --Acknowledge God besides Allah, including embracing atheism and religious beliefs, giving offerings, believing in Gods and Goddesses, believing that something can bring harm & benefit without any guidance from Islam and without scientific basis (eg believing in Javanese day counting). --Magic: become a shaman, psychic, spiritualist, supernatural expert, metaphysician, internal energy practitioner, reiki practitioner, ask them for help on the supernatural & believe in predictions. Many shamans dress as ustadz or clerics. --Fit animal. --Making animals as targets for shooting or throwing. --Make sculptures of sentient beings --Behaving arbitrarily towards animals. --Separation of kin ties. --Killing a soul that Allah has forbidden to kill: heating up / encouraging others to kill, aborting a womb that is several days old etc. --Do usury (ask for profit from lending money). --Take other people's property illegally, for example stealing, extortion, civil servants who receive gifts from the people served etc. --No fardhu prayer. --No tumakninah in prayer. -- Postponing fardhu prayers until the time runs out. --Not fasting Ramadan. --Not paying zakat. --Not doing Hajj until 4 years for those who can afford it. --Fornication. --Having deviant sex: same-sex sex, sex with animals, sex with wife when the wife hasn't taken a junub bath after postpartum & menstruation & sex through the anus. -- Angry at Allah's destiny. -- Hates righteous people. --Bring into conflict. --Screaming, tearing clothes, swearing etc. when disaster strikes. --Accusing without proof --Consuming unclean food. --Men resemble women & women resemble men. --Not paying debts immediately when able, not immediately returning borrowed items, damaging borrowed items etc. --Striking out other people's belongings or public facilities. --Hire people then don't pay their wages/salary. --Women & men are clothed but naked: thin &/ tight &/ women open their thighs, chest, back, armpits, shoulders, stomach, buttocks etc. --Changing God's creation: plastic surgery, wearing braces, eyebrow embroidery, hair extensions etc. --Tattoo & ask to be tattooed. --Not paying salaries / wages of employees on time even though they are capable. --Arrogant: reject the truth & belittle people. --Help with sin. --Dye hair black. --Calling giving --Riya: worship to get praise --Bribed & bribed. --Cheating in buying and selling. -- Disobedient to parents: refusing their orders, louder, mocking them, not supporting those who are poor etc. --Muslims marry infidels. --Marrying a woman who is in Iddah period. -- Disobedience to husband: louder voice, mocking him, refusing his request to do something / not doing something even though he is capable, using the husband's property (not a proper living that has been given by the husband) without his permission etc. -- Husband does not pay dowry, does not provide for his wife's children according to his ability, allows his wife's children to sin, uses his wife's property without his permission, mocks him, physically hurts him, etc. -- Wife asks for divorce without good reason, for example because she likes another man. --Wife sued for divorce but did not return the dowry. --Dividing inheritance is not in accordance with Islamic inheritance law. --Swearing falsely. --Swearing by names other than Allah, for example, By Allah for the sake of Rosulullaah. --Breaking a promise. --Supporting infidels and people who like to sin to become leaders even though there are righteous Muslims. --Recognizing a person who is not the biological father as the biological father.",positive,,EN,,,8,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,,1,postmagazine,user{user},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,P00,,,C

Stopping cross-border vehicle smuggling is a regular [â€¦] Modise explains what's being done to fight crime in South Africa defenceWeb - Email Defence and Military Veterans Minister Thandi Modise was JCPS cluster spokesperson for a national crime update. Defence and Military Veterans Minister Thandi Modise, as point person for last week's JCPS (Justice, Crime Prevention and Security) Cabinet cluster meeting, gave an overview of government crime busting and fighting efforts across fronts ranging from illegal mining through to the so-called construction mafia, cross-border crimes and others. Stopping cross-border vehicle smuggling is a regular occurrence for soldiers deployed on the national border protection tasking Operation Corona with monthly reports noting vehicle recoveries on South Africa's land borders with Mozambique and Zimbabwe among others. The KwaZulu-Natal/Mozambique border is one where illegal vehicle exports resulted in thinking out of the box. This saw large rocks put at known crossing points to deny smugglers easy outs and later led to fabrication of reinforced concrete Jersey barriers to shut smuggling routes. In her briefing Modise said: A task team deployed to prevent and combat cross border vehicle smuggling continues to register commendable progress. Since deployment in February this year, over 140 suspects have been arrested for theft, car hijackings and murder. Sixty-four vehicles were recovered and 57 firearms seized. In August, police registered a breakthrough, when three wanted suspects linked to a spate of vehicle smuggling between Mozambique and South Africa were arrested. The trio are apparently linked to a crime activist executed in February, she said. Modise elaborated on the Presidential employment of more than three thousand soldiers to assist police efforts in bringing illegal miners â€“ better known as zama zamas â€“ to heel, saying an integrated illegal mining and other crimes intervention plan was developed by the JCPS and NICOC (National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee). No less than 14 government entities ranging from national departments to task specific authorities and units were involved. Arrests to date for illegal mining and relate charges are 4 067. Success-wise, to date, according to the Defence and Military Veterans Minister, 28 intelligence-driven operations, 360 disruptive operations, a similar number of simultaneous roadblocks, 130 joint spaza operations, 108 restaurant joint operations, four hotel operations, 353 compliance inspections and 48 borderline operations have been conducted. In Mpumalanga a national intervention team (NIT) working solely on illegal mining and Eskom saw 67 arrests along with coal worth R12 million and R180 million worth of mining equipment confiscated. The five month period from April to August saw 329 suspects accused of illicit mining offences, she said, without detail of exact charges, amounts and equipment involved. Also part of the illegal mining intervention is what is termed sealing illegal mines and shafts. By way of explanation Modise said: Across South Africa there are 6 100 derelict and ownerless mines. Some are old and the owners cannot be traced. There are 1 170 â€˜mine openings' nationally and in Gauteng there are 518. DMRE (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy) is going to rehabilitate three mines and has closed 40 mine openings per year and [is] conducting research. The department has plans to deal with this issue over a period of time. Additionally, laws on the Statute Book relevant to illegal mining are and will be reviewed. This will enable law enforcement to close all possible loopholes. In summary, Modise pointed out NATJOINTS (the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure) has set short, medium and long term goals to arrest the situation. Included in the short to medium term goals is stabilising the situation, deploying teams in identified problematic areas after which task teams will move into a normalisation period. In similar fashion, provincial JOINTS have been activated to deal with illegal mining and conduct regular operations. To further bolster the fight against illegal mining, President Ramaphosa authorised the employment of members of the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) for service in co-operation with the SA Police Service (SAPS) to prevent and combat crime and maintain and preserve law and order under Operation Prosper, she said, adding the military/police illegal mining partnership would cover all nine provinces. We will make sure that as the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security cluster, we create a safe and secure environment for our people to live [in], Modise said during Friday's briefing. South Africans have borne the wrath of criminals masquerading in our communities causing disruption in their daily lives. In some parts of our communities, extortion and protection fees demanded by criminal syndicates have become the order of the day. These and other criminal activities have put fear in our people and undermine the authority of the state. Through the SAPS Operation Shanela, South Africa has adopted a decisive approach in reducing the high levels of crime, Modise said, with high intensity operations from May 2023. It is through Operation Shanela, that the SAPS has successfully arrested 213 059 suspects for various crimes such as cash-in transit robberies, extortion at construction sites and kidnappings in the past six months. During the same period, 2 657 illegal and unwanted firearms were confiscated, Modise said. The operation led to the arrest of 19 299 suspects arrested for drug possession while 7 580 were arrested for drug trafficking and dealing in the last six months. On cash-in-transit (CIT) heists and associated crimes, law enforcement agencies continue to make inroads with the police arresting 75 wanted suspects in the past six months. On the drugs front, the latest drug busts are a clear indication government remains committed to the fight against drug trafficking, Modise said. It is encouraging that nine drug laboratories worth more than R3 million were dismantled in Gauteng, North West and the Western Cape. In the space of three weeks, police intercepted large quantities of cocaine in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. The latest cocaine consignment was seized last week at the sea port in Gqeberha where R65 million worth of cocaine was seized from a vessel coming in from Brazil, Modise said. Two other drugs busts were made in KwaZulu-Natal where R150 million worth of cocaine was seized in two days. As regards extortion at economic and construction sites, Modise said various threats were identified that impact negatively on the economy of the country. From April 2023 to date, 61 suspects linked to extortion were arrested. Since 2019, 27 accused have been convicted for a collective 43 years direct imprisonment. On kidnapping for ransom, Modise said from April 2023 to date, 98 suspects were arrested and more than 30 victims rescued. The cluster said government continues to deploy Anti-Gang-Unit members in provinces prone to gang violence such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Gauteng.

The newspaper adds that it rang a bell at the Bank of Italy, which informed the country's secret services and the relevant parliamentary committee. This move is not justified by the financial sanctions, given that the bank accounts of the embassies did not suffer special restrictions, writes La Repubblica. At the same time, he adds that the possibility that the embassy workers had to be paid in cash is not convincing and that the most worrying, and perhaps more realistic case, is that it is money related to a more complex strategy, which provides for the collection and channeling of informationn.

The Bank of Italy raises concerns over the Russian Embassy in Rome's withdrawal of approximately 4 million euros, sparking speculations of potential influence and information leakage. â€¢ 34 mins ago Russian Embassy in Rome Raises Suspicions with Large Cash Withdrawals Italy's Bank of Italy has raised concerns over the withdrawal of an estimated 4 million euros from the bank accounts of the Russian embassy in Rome, as reported by the Italian newspaper, La Repubblica. The financial operations have been deemed suspicious, prompting alert notifications to the country's secret services and the relevant parliamentary committee. Motives Behind the Withdrawals According to La Repubblica, the considerable amount of withdrawals could not be justified by economic sanctions as diplomatic accounts are not significantly restricted. The paper also questioned the credibility of the idea that embassy workers were being paid in cash, suggesting that the funds could be tied to a more complex strategy involving the collection and dissemination of information. Speculations on Kremlin Influence La Repubblica speculated that a part of the withdrawn funds might have been used to solicit influencers in a bid to advocate Kremlin's positions and sway Italian public opinion. This speculation raises concerns about the potential manipulation of social discourse and the political landscape. Concerns Over Possible Leaks The article also touched on the possibility of the funds being used to bribe individuals, potentially within the armed forces, to release sensitive information, such as details about new weapons. This scenario, if true, could pose a serious threat to national security and requires immediate investigation. 0 ",negative,,EN,,,"6,3",UNKNOWN,99,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://media.bnn.network/content/uploads/2023/11/russian-embassy-suspicious-withdrawals-20231115023910.jpg,5000,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1500,0,0,P00,,,P

It's easier said than done, but when an act can engage with an audience in a memorable way while creating music that's purely pristine, they're bound to get people's attention. Consisting of Tema Siegel on lead vocals, Zach Blankenstein on guitar, bass and backing vocals, Jared Gozinsky on drums and percussion, Will Griffin on bass, Danny Silverton on keyboards, Jeffrey Pinsker-Smith trumpet and Eric Tarlin on saxophone, synthesizer and backing vocals, Boston indie pop act Couch have a knack for pulling this off in emphatic fashion. Folks will get to see what they're all about when they perform at Park City Music Hall in Bridgeport on November 16 as part of a show presented by Cheshire's Counter Weight Brewing Company. Fellow Bostonian Alison Amador will be opening things up at 8 p.m. I had a talk with both Blankenstein and Tarlin ahead of the show about the band's musical roots, releasing a new EP a few days ago, touring the United Kingdom for the first time and what they're looking to accomplish going into next year. RD: Couch has a sound that combines funk, rock and R&B, which is further developed by your backgrounds in jazz, a cappella and musical theater. How did you all come together from these different places? Did you all go to high school together? ZB: A bunch of us knew each other around the time of high school and early college. We all went to different high schools, but they're all within the Boston area. Each of us were looking for a musical outlet and our vision and goals all sort of aligned and met up at the right time. With seven different people, there's seven different tastes in music so that's where you're getting that combination of lots of different styles. That's basically how we came together. RD: When it comes to performing on stage, do you guys take cues from different theater productions that you've been in and integrate them into your approach to live music? ET: I wouldn't say that we're directly pulling from specific theater productions, but Tema went to school for musical theater and a lot of her vocal style as well as her stage presence can be traced back to that. The rest of us have performed in various settings whether it's jazz, a cappella or temple music groups, so everyone has their own different backgrounds. We also just inject a lot of our own senses of humor while on stage, we like to goof around and have fun with each other. All of those different factors come together and create what we do up there. RD: Very cool. On November 3, Couch released a new EP titled Sunshower. Where was it recorded and did you all have a specific vision for the record? It kind of seems like a record that echoes summer, but it came out in the fall. ZB: We definitely have a bright, positive sound that people often equate with summer and we spent a lot of this past summer working on this, so you can hear that vibe in the EP. It was mostly recorded at our homes, we have a few different studio setups and it's a pretty DIY process. For some of the more involved recordings, we have drums, live piano and things like that and we'll rent a studio, but the entire process took place in Boston and the surrounding areas to keep the roots there. RD: You guys also did a sold-out tour of the United Kingdom recently, right? ET: Yeah we did, it was our first time out there. RD: What was the experience like for you guys being across the Atlantic? ET: It was surreal. My favorite part was hearing people singing our lyrics with accents that I don't usually get to hear. It was a landmark set of performances for us because we have a lot of friends in the Northeast, we're a big band and there's seven of us so there are usually personal connections, friends and family helping populate our crowds a little bit. Over in the U.K., it was all just Couch fans and it was a nice reminder that people really resonate with our music in all different parts of the world, so it was a really special experience for us. RD: I can totally imagine, especially with you guys being in a different country and playing to new audiences. After the upcoming show at Park City Music Hall, what are some goals that Couch is looking to accomplish going into 2024? ZB: This current tour that we're on in support of the Sunshower EP is going to take us into the new year and we're going to wrap up the East Coast this weekend with a string of shows that includes a stop in Bridgeport. Then next month and into the beginning of 2024, we're going to be playing in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Austin, Dallas, Chicago, Indianapolis and Detroit. All the while, we're hoping to start working on new music while continuing to promote and get people excited about the new record.

COASST is focused on the intersection of science, conservation, and communities. COASST participants help make a difference for the environment by collecting data on beach-cast carcasses of marine birds and marine debris on a monthly basis to establish the baseline pattern of beached bird mortality and debris deposition on North Pacific beaches. Through an interactive, hands-on workshop, trainees will become acquainted with COASST survey protocols, have a chance to learn more about the seabirds that live in their area, and learn about the effects of marine debris on sea life. The COASST training provides participants with the tools to monitor for potential changes in the marine environment and promote stewardship of local marine resources. COASST is a citizen science project of the University of Washington in partnership with state, tribal, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and community groups. COASST believes residents of coastal communities are essential scientific partners in monitoring marine ecosystem health. By collaborating with community members, natural resource management agencies and environmental organizations, COASST works to translate long-term monitoring into effective marine conservation solutions. Currently, nearly 1000 participants survey beaches in Washington, Oregon, California, and Alaska. The training session will be held at RE Sources (2309 Meridian St, Bellingham, WA 98225). There will be a short break in the middle of the session for lunch, so please bring your own sack lunch, or money to purchase food in the area. Beach surveys are best conducted in groups of 2 or more, so please come with a survey partner in mind or plan to join a team during training. Participants need NO prior experience with scientific data collection, just a commitment to survey a specific beach at least once a month. COVID-19 details: Masks are recommended, but not mandatory. Staying safe is our top priority and we will have disinfectant wipes and sanitizer on hand. For more information and to reserve your training spot, call COASST at 206-221-6893 or email coasst@uw.edu.

Girl, like a Courtney Love costume (rumpled icy-pink camisole, fishnets). Boy, like a guy Lana Del Rey would write a song about (fur-trimmed hood, cigarette held between forefinger and thumb, cargo shorts). Then â€” Clark Gable moustache, loafers, old Hollywood Brylcreem hair, purple tartan waistcoat. It's all over the place. Bonkers. The kid looks great. Trends now move so fast that we are approaching a point at which they are becoming irrelevant. We reference and collage. Chimera ensembles. Frankenstein outfits. An era in which anything goes. Creating distinct personal style and rebuking trends â€” or perhaps having a dalliance with them â€” using secondhand pieces is delicious and feels truly sustainable. Fashion archives such as Haut, created by Hanna Samson, offer such a possibility. With the â€˜buy now' culture, everything is readily available, from sex, to clothes, to food. Everything has sped up so much. Why do we constantly need new stuff? Samson tells me. I love finding pieces that remain timeless and even trendy â€“ trendy is fun â€“ and to allow these pieces to be worn, communicated, have a life of their own beyond being owned by anyone, with different people, have different conversations. Cardigan RAF SIMONS from STOF Belt Stylist's own Trousers Stylist's own Jacket RIP CURL from 403RCHVE Skirt CHANEL from Haut Shoes PRADA from Bajo STOF is an Antwerp-based archive created by Maude Van Dievoet and Karina Zharmukhambetova. Van Dievoet describes how the archive took shape through a combination of the appreciation for the timelessness, craft, taste and mystery that embodies Belgian fashion and childhood experiences: Our mums were our first and biggest role models in developing a personal style. We grew up with these adventures of always searching for something with that little extra touch, even when it was secondhand. Van Dievoet continues, we want to build something that's here to stay and for people to be able to reappreciate all that has been made already. With us both having backgrounds in fashion, we wanted to stay away from the typical cycle of trends and seasons. Archives offer a curated collection of rare secondhand pieces that can feel daunting to try and find yourself, scouring through eBay or charity shops. Gorgeous pieces STOF has let go of include: A.F. Vandevorst fury boots, yellow Ann Demeulemeester chainmail hoodie, Maison Martin Margiela burgundy sweater sack bag SS95. More than this, the idea of an archive immediately positions fashion as consequential in the same way as art or literature. Personally, we consider the combination of craftsmanship and true passion as art, whether this is reflected in a piece of clothing or in a poem. Dievoet notes. Samson also touches on this: I like the idea of a gallery, how things come and they go. I see myself as a curator, presenting these garments to a community then seeing them off. Jacket DIESEL from 403RCHVE Top ANN DEMEULEMEESTER from Haut Skirt MARITHÃ‰ + FRANÃ‡OIS GIRBAUD from Haut Jeans Stylist's own Jacket JUNYA WATANABE from Haut Top A.F. VANDEVORST from STOF Skirt PRADA from Bajo Shoes PRADA from Bajo Violette Marrel, who runs Bajo archive, describes how she comes from a family of hoarders, a term I use affectionately â€” I love collecting things, learning their stories and discovering how you relate to a garment, what it brings you and what you bring to it. She goes on: I read this quote recently from Balzac that says l'homme qui ne voit dans la mode que la mode est un sot, which reads as the man who only sees fashion in fashion is a fool â€” I think that clothes are so important and relevant to how we carry ourselves in culture and society. Clothes are baggage. We remember the weave of a mother's jumper, the party shirt we wore when we met the most beautiful boy with that hot-fudge voice, face toward a six-o'clock sun. Clothes are emotional. People have nervous breakdowns over a pair of shoes. When my 1999 Miu Miu wallet was stolen in Athens, long, deranged hours were spent rooting though markets in the dicey part of town where thieves re-sell their stolen goods. Contents â€” irrelevant. Wallet â€” everything. Sometimes the emotion isn't personal but cultural. Marrel regrets parting with a pair of Prada Mary Janes that Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) wears in Legally Blonde when she has her trial breakthrough moment. I feel like I let go of a little bit of me when I parted with them. So often when buying archival designs, there is a personal relationship that has already been established between the piece (a personally significant collection, Elle Woods wore it) and the buyer, before it even comes in contact with the body. This meaning rarely exists with fast fashion. For Marrel, the purpose of collecting clothes lies in all the hours dedicated to finding the season, the collection and the context that piece of clothing was made in. I love the story behind it and finding out what the designer was trying to say, what kind of person they were trying to show. Samson describes her personal relationship to clothes differently. Fashion is the industry; clothes are a separate thing to that. Clothes have helped me separate myself from the world, it's this mix of expressing and escaping along with connecting with people. It's helped me understand my emotional attachment to things, to ideas, and to process information around me too. T shirt HELMUT LANG from Haut Skirt COMME DES GARÃ‡ONS from Bajo Top from Bajo Shoes A.F. VANDEVORST from STOF A sucker for early 2000's Diesel, Roshan Whittaker, who runs 403RCHVE, believes the secondhand clothing industry plays a large part in enabling fashion to be sustainable. He continues, I see fashion as an art form to express individual, cultural and political ideologiesâ€¦ The craftsmanship that goes into these archival pieces requires the equal care and preservation as artâ€¦ my personal style was developed through a passion of treasure hunting for these one-of-a-kind pieces. The exciting part always came from not knowing what was going to be found, that's the beauty of it! Shirt RAF SIMONS from STOF Top ANN DEMEULEMEESTER from STOF Jeans DIESEL from 403RCHVE Jacket PLEIN SUD from Haut Top JEAN PAUL GAULTIER from Bajo Skirt from 403RCHVE Boots from STOF Uniting these four archives is an obsession with beautiful, layered things. Garments that have more running through them than the fibres they're made from. They're pieces that stand powerfully by themselves, with important backstories, or that reflect the designer's creative process, and build a community that appreciates this sentiment, Samson says. I think about the quote: â€˜Some designers make clothes for the customer; some make clothes to express themselves.' In a way I want to further the garments that were an expression, an output of the designer's thoughts at the time, to the present-day.

Especially the look with the taffeta apron escaping underneath, says Simone Rocha. But my favourite piece is the shawl collar jacket with the voluminous bomber sleeve. I felt that this was a reflection of my introduction to menswear. Rocha is pointing out items from one of her most recent collections, designed for this spring and summer. It's an important season for Rocha. Because, while she made her official debut at London Fashion Week in 2010 and has been one of its marquee names ever since, her SS23 show marked the designer's all-embracing foray into menswear. All clothing STEFAN COOKE Earrings Stylist's own Her designs had for a while crossed over definitions of mens- and womenswear. In turn influenced by fine art, folk traditions or traditions of making clothing (think nostalgic embroideries or intricate knitting stitches unique to Ireland's Aran Islands), Rocha has also made details drawn out in lace, pearls, tulle, ruffles and furbelows her signature. These touches from Rocha â€“ who was born in Ireland and trained at Central Saint Martins in London â€“ contrasts with biker jackets, tailored separates and sometimes flat brogues; all traditionally building blocks of the masculine wardrobe. I wanted to explore menswear as part of the Simone Rocha narrative and it felt like the right time to explore the relationship between my womenswear and menswear, she explains. To introduce my codes to their own menswear identity. Top ISA BOULDER Skirt STEFAN COOKE Trousers STEFAN COOKE Shoes STEFAN COOKE Earrings Stylist's own All clothing ISA BOULDER Shoes NATIONAL THEATRE Rocha unveiled her SS23 designs in a cavernous space inside London's Old Bailey, staging a co-ed show. There is a crossover of ideas and emotion, and influences of fabrications and silhouettes, she says. They are coming from one place, but each is their own reactive individual character. For men to choose from: the aforementioned bomber jacket, fitted with billowing sleeves and smock-like dropped shoulders, white cotton shirting, a rain mac with bishop sleeves. Army green fatigues come zipped and buckled, matched with sandals and socks embroidered in white pearls tracing a floral daisy motif. I looked a lot at uniforms, tailoring, and how they would be unzipped to reveal what was underneath, both rough and smooth, healing and harnessing, she notes. Top ISA BOULDER Skirt SIMONE ROCHA Socks Stylist's own Shoes Stylist's own All clothing STEFAN COOKE This season, Rocha is but one of the designers mirroring what they usually create with a mens- or womenswear offering. At their production set-up in Bali, Indonesia, Cecilia Basari and Yuli Suri of fledgling label Isa Boulder worked with local makers to define what their menswear could look like. The two founded Isa Boulder in 2010 with a line of swimwear, later branching into knitwear; this season, cue free-flowing knits woven from recycled textiles and hand-spun yarns. All clothing STEFAN COOKE Tights Stylist's own We had developed some womenswear ideas over the last couple of years but never fully committed, Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt write in an email. The two met whilst studying for their Master's degree from Central Saint Martins; Cooke and Burt launched Stefan Cooke, their brand, in 2017. At Stefan Cooke, silhouettes are slim-fitting, knitwear is made in the UK and comes with cut-outs placed just so, and this season, denim is finessed with cord braiding, nodding to fantasy uniforms. It was also this season that the duo decided to fully launch womenswear. SS23 was different because we started with womenswear and were really happy with the early results, they reflect. We scheduled fittings all the time and had a friend model so the process was really quick, instinctive and fun. All clothing SIMONE ROCHA Shoes STEFAN COOKE Their instincts gave shape to light blue denim bomber jackets embroidered with a ceremonial chain motif, printed silk scarves and ruffled skirts. A white mini dress ends in two tiers of volants and blue taffeta bows, embroidered into a web-like pattern. Our approach to designing women's only differs slightly from menswear, Cooke and Burt explain. The research is the same, but we found we could be more direct with how this research was referenced. So much of the decisions were made instinctively during fittings and the process was less laboured compared to making convincing menswear with the same research. Their latest work has been embraced by many. The group of people we collaborate with on shows and campaigns have always really encouraged us to create a focused women's offering too.

1221915165,WWW.PORT-MAGAZINE.COM,11/15/2023,WEB,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.port-magazine.com/music/each-page-is-just-a-little-song/,Each Page is Just a Little Song,"Each Page is Just a Little Song Each Page is Just a Little Song Words Samir Chadha Catching up with Jake Ewald of Slaughter Beach, Dog, around a new album and the reading and writing that went into it Slaughter Beach, Dog has been through a few forms. It started as a solo outlet from Jake Ewald's work in beloved emo band Modern Baseball, but following that band's hiatus, became a larger band, initially with Modern Baseball bandmate Ian Farmer on bass, and now including drummer Zach Robbins, guitarist Adam Meisterhans and keyboard player Logan Roth. It's a roomy project that changes from album to album: Welcome was warm; Birdie goes between sparse and springy; Safe and Also No Fear is darker and more brooding; At the Moonbase adopts an identity and saxophone layer all its own. The most recent album, Crying, Laughing, Waving, Smiling, is much more candid, and much folkier. The name itself is an edit of sorts â€“ Ewald wanted to name the band after Slaughter Beach in Delaware, but a European band were already using the name, so he added â€˜, Dog'. There's always been a literary side to the band; Ewald talked about Welcome, the first album, as a fictional world, and has discussed his writing and reading in a few places, notably in a newsletter he's been writing monthly since the start of last year. We spoke over the phone shortly before the release of Crying, Laughing, Waving, Smiling. At The Moonbase, Slaughter Beach, Dog's last album, was mostly you working on your own â€“ you've said before that you were working on another album with the rest of the band. Is Crying, Laughing, Waving, Smiling related to that album, or is it an entirely new thing? That's right. We were planning to go into the studio, we had just finished the tour, and then it was like smack dab the beginning of COVID when we really had, you know, no vaccines, no idea what was going on. We were too spooked to try to work together. I was itching. I had been sitting on the songs for so long that I just wanted to get them out of the way, so I could write new songs. I just ended up recording it at home. Then we pushed back whatever the next full band thing we would do. Yeah, that ended up being Crying, Laughing, Waving, Smiling. We ended up getting together to record those summer 2022. So two years behind. It does feel like it's picking up the same thread as the albums before Moonbase, but with a lot of the extra instrumentation you did on Moonbase that I feel like was quite new. Like Birdie, for example, is a lot more sparse. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Part of that was on purpose with Birdie. It was just me and Ian in the studio and we really wanted to do something that was kind of wholly focused on the songs without much else. Moonbase was a little bit the opposite â€“ I really wanted to go crazy on it. The cool thing about CLWS is that we've never done these loaded arrangements that were recorded in a live setting â€“ where it's actually five people in the room playing as opposed to, you know, me holing up in the studio and just layering a bunch of stuff up on top. The general rundown was that we got together, the five of us, and recorded, drums, bass, guitar, keyboard for, something like 20 songs, and then we started whittling them down as time went by, figuring out which ones we liked the most. I redid the vocals on my own, and we replaced some of the keyboards with real pianos down the line â€“ Zach added a bunch of extraneous stints at the end. But yeah, the bones of the songs were the five of us in the room playing them for the first time, figuring them out in real time. All those takes are on the record. All the drums are just, you know, the drums that happened when we first sat down to play the song, same with the bass, same with a lot of the guitars. How do you feel about that new way of working? It wasn't totally new, but it was absolutely my first time doing it in a setting where all the musicians were so comfortable with each other. In different iterations, we'd all been playing together for a little bit. Maybe even more important than that was that I've never made a record like that at this age, which is obvious, but, you know, everybody in that room â€“ at the point that we made the record â€“ had played in so many bands, played on so many records, been through so many iterations of doing this. There was this calm, straightforward, open, listening perspective that we were all able to get on, in a way that I had never really experienced before. I feel like so many of the records I made when I was younger were trying to prove something, or trying to put something for myself forward. Here everybody was on the same page, and everybody just wanted to lift up the songs as best we could. I've always written the bones of the songs by myself and then brought them to some version of the band. With Birdie, I just went in the room with Ian, then with Safe and Also No Fear, it was me and Ian and Zack and the guitar player at the time, Nick. Then Moonbase, like I said, I went back and did by myself. Me and Ian and Zack, we've just done so much together. We even went on a tour, maybe more than one tour, where it was just us playing as a trio. So with this record, it's a really interesting mix of this super tuned-in, long-time connection the three of us have, and new variables thrown in, with Adam and with Logan, to get some more surprises happening. Is there anything that you feel like is really tied to the record books wise for you, or writer wise? I was thinking about this a couple weeks ago, trying to figure out if there was a certain type of thing I was reading that ended up on the record. I feel like I ended up with more story songs than usual on this one. I was digging through my library, and one of the first things that popped out to me was remembering that I read Faulkner's As I Lay Dying in which every chapter is written from a different character's perspective. It's obviously been done so many times since then, probably before then, but the way that he did it really affected me, and pushed me to try to inhabit my own characters with as much care and grace as he does. Oh, and 2666 by Roberto BolaÃ±o . That one's less of a straightforward chapter-by-character kind of thing, but it's broken up into these big sections where it's these different stories revolving around the same thing. Then the other day I remembered â€“ did you ever read The Copenhagen Trilogy? [by Tove Ditlesen, translated by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman] Man, it was so good. Probably the only time where I've gotten hit over the head with such good press about a book and it actually came through. It blew my mind how short it was, because she just distills everything impeccably. She just reduces it down â€“ just reduces her whole life down to this super simple, concrete narrative that still manages to have really visceral, intimate moments. But it's refined so far, you're moving through the narrative so quickly. It starts from when she's a child, like her earliest memories as a child, and then it goes through growing up, becoming a teenager, getting married, having her own kids, dealing with addiction issues. It's broken up into three sections technically, but all three sections together are I think less than 200 pages. So it's really short. It's the same philosophy that I appreciate â€“ have come to appreciate â€“ in song, where you really have to refine what you're trying to say because you only have two and a half minutes. You have to take something really meaningful, and a lot of times larger than life, but sift through it, find the parts that mean the most, and create a storyline when you stack them all on top of each other. It read like a song, it was one of those. You've said you like Lydia Davis before â€“ that sort of ruthless honing things down sounds a bit like her. Yeah, for sure. That goes back to a bunch of years ago. I got her Collected Stories. They're mostly â€“ this is almost all of her work â€“ nothing more than three pages, most of them are",positive,,EN,,,"5,48",UNITED KINGDOM,319,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://storage.googleapis.com/s8partner-pm_wp/1/2023/10/PROMO-3.jpg,12165,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,3649,0,0,P00,,,P

Get a Redmi Note 12 series phone, plus other deals from Germany Peter, 12 November 2023 The Redmi Note series doesn't challenge the flagships from the main Xiaomi line, but these models do bring some impressive cameras and decently fast chipsets at a low price. The Redmi Note 12 Pro+ is the top of the line model with a 200MP main camera â€“ a fairly large 1/1.4 sensor with in-sensor zoom capabilities and the f/1.7 lens also supports OIS. The 8MP ultra wide and 16MP selfie cameras seem almost pedestrian in comparison. The Pro+ model boasts 120W fast charging for its 5,000mAh battery â€“ in our testing 15 minutes was enough to get to 81% with Boost enabled (and 58% with it disabled). The display is a 6.67 FHD+ panel with 10-bit colors (and Dolby Vision and HDR10+) and a 120Hz refresh rate. Xiaomi picked the Dimensity 1080 as the brain of this phone.

Images of dummy models indicate that subtle changes Samsung has made to the Galaxy S24 series have given the phones a new character. Anam Hamid 11 If rumors are true, the Samsung Galaxy S24 series has entered production and will be unveiled in the US on January 17, slightly earlier than the Galaxy S23 . Renders and rumors have suggested that the phones will be a minor upgrade over the current generation, with largely the same design and specs as their predecessors. To give us a sense of what the phones will actually look like, veteran leaker Sonny Dickson has posted some images of dummy units of the Galaxy S24 series. At first glance, the phones look identical to the Galaxy S23 series but upon closer inspection it's evident that Samsung has made some subtle changes that lend a new character to the design. Galaxy S24 vs S24 Plus dummy models Starting with the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus, the phones' backs look similar to their predecessors' rears, but their edges are flatter. And though you might not be able to tell just by looking at the images, the base model is slightly taller and thinner than the Galaxy S23. In a similar set of photos shared by reliable leaker Steve H.McFly , we also get to see the Galaxy S24's screen, which is said to have grown a little from 6.1-inch to 6.17-inch. It also apparently has slimmer bezels. Galaxy S24 screen The Galaxy S24 Plus , on the other hand, is seemingly a little thicker than the S23 Plus, and like the standard model, it's also expected to have thin, symmetrical bezels. Coming to the Galaxy S24 Ultra , the back of the phone looks identical - albeit a little flatter - to that of its predecessor, but it will allegedly have a flat display and could be a hair shorter and wider. It is also said to have the narrowest bezel of any phone. Galaxy S24 family dummies We don't know what the original source of this leak is, but given that the images of the same set of dummy units were posted by two well-known leakers, we are inclined to believe that they are a close approximation of the actual phones. That said, the Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn't seem to feature the new speaker design that was leaked by Ice Universe, so it's best to take this leak with a pinch of sale.

For years, iQOO has been making some fantastic smartphones. And, in 2024, the iQOO 12 may finally bring all the limelight and recognition the company has long deserved. Listen to Story New Delhi,UPDATED: Nov 14, 2023 19:47 IST In Short iQOO 12 series is officially set to launch in India on December 12. The smartphone will be the first device to launch in India powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Given the specs and upgrades, expect a price bump for the iQOO 12 over the iQOO 11. iQOO has been making some fantastic phones and I think 2024 could finally be its year. Just a few days ago, the iQOO 12 and the iQOO 12 Pro were officially launched in China. Both of them look very exciting but, what does this mean for the India release? What's new about the brand new upcoming phones or should we say phone? advertisement Okay, the first thing to address â€” when is the iQOO 12 series releasing in India and are both the 12 and 12 Pro launching? Well, iQOO has officially dropped the India launch date which is set for December 12. Now, historically, while iQOO has launched vanilla and Pro models in China, the Pro model actually didn't make its way to India, so my hunch is â€” India will only get the vanilla iQOO 12. However, I will be more than happy if the iQOO 12 Pro also launches in India. But, then again, the price of that phone will go sky high, and as good as iQOO phones are, sadly, they don't sell all that well in the flagship segment. So, for now, let's focus on the vanilla iQOO 12, which is most likely coming to India on December 12. In terms of prices, the iQOO 12 price in China starts at CNY 3,999 (roughly Rs 46,5000) for the 12GB + 256GB storage version. Then, there's the 16GB + 512GB storage variant priced at CNY 4,299 (roughly Rs 50,000) and the 16GB + 1TB storage variant is priced at Rs CNY 4,699, (roughly Rs 55,000). Now, of course, these won't be the exact Indian prices of the iQOO 12. In fact, if iQOO 11 is any indication, I think only the 12GB + 256GB version and 16GB + 512GB version will launch in India. And also considering there was a good enough difference of about Rs 10,000-Rs 12,000 between the India and China prices of the iQOO 11, I am expecting the iQOO 12 price in India could range anywhere between Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000. My exact guesses would be Rs 64,999 for 12 + 256 and Rs 69,999 for 16 + 512. Of course, they can always bring in bank discounts and offers and bring the prices down, but yes, this is what I think. And, with the kind of pricing, what specs and features and upgrades you are getting on the iQOO 12? First up, there's a huge design departure from past iQOO flagship phones. The new iQOO 12 sports a new and huge camera module at the rear. Of course, upgraded cameras at the rear â€” a 50MP primary, a 64MP telephoto lens with 100x digital zoom, a 50MP ultra-wide camera and a 16MP selfie snapper at the front. Personally, I am a huge fan of large camera modules. I loved it on the Vivo X series, loved it on the OnePlus Open and personally, can't wait to see and test this camera in person. advertisement On the front, the iQOO 12 retains the flat display of its predecessor. The bezels look to be slimmer than before. However, the big upgrade is the E7 AMOLED panel, with 1.5K resolution. It's a 10-bit panel, has a 144Hz refresh rate, supports HDR10+ playback, and has 1400 nits typical brightness and up to 3,000 nits peak brightness. So, this technically makes it the brightest panel on a phone. One other big upgrade on the iQOO 12 is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip under the hood, and courtesy of leaks, we have already heard about the performance gains it brings to the table. Now, I only hope it delivers as well. By the way, the iQOO 12 will also be the first phone to launch in India with the 8 Gen 3 chipset. advertisement Other than this, the iQOO 12's battery capacity is still the same as the iQOO 11, i.e. 5,000mAh, which is big. Charging is 120W, which is still very fast. Of course, the latest Funtouch OS 14-based Android 14 will likely launch in India as opposed to OriginOS in China. And yes, that's pretty much about the iQOO 12. Now the only difference that I could figure out between the iQOO 12 and iQOO 12 Pro is that the Pro has a higher resolution screen, i.e. 1.5K on iQOO 12 and 2K resolution on the 12 Pro. The Pro model also comes with an IP68 rating. It has a slightly larger 5,100mah battery, and it also supports 50W wireless charging and 10W reverse wireless charging. And with these extra features, the base variant of the iQOO 12 Pro starts at CNY 1,000 more, which also makes me think, if iQOO does decide to launch the 12 Pro in India, the prices will breach the Rs 70,000 mark. Are people willing to buy an iQOO for over Rs 70,000? For now, are you excited about the iQOO 12 series coming to India? What do you think â€” will the Chinese smartphone maker only release the iQOO 12 or will the company also release the iQOO 12 Pro? Either way, we are soon going to get all the answers on December 12th.

Since especially highly populated countries like the Netherlands are located along the coastline with much of their land mass below NAP, dredging is required to combat the expected rise of sea levels due to climate change. Home Dredging Today Autonomous dredging requires less energy than the conventional one Autonomous dredging requires less energy than the conventional one November 14, 2023, posted by Zlatan Hrvacevic Share this article Dredging is a necessary but energy consuming activity. Since especially highly populated countries like the Netherlands are located along the coastline with much of their land mass below NAP, dredging is required to combat the expected rise of sea levels due to climate change. Photo courtesy of C-Job C-Job Naval Architects developed the ALERD to perform dredging activities in a sustainable and energy reduced manner. The ALERD (Autonomous Low Energy Replenishment Dredger) was developed together with MARIN as a concept for the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat for a sustainable and cost-effective â€˜Solution for Coastal Care'. C-Job did extensive research to determine the actual energy requirement of ALERD. One of the main driving forces for the development of ALERD was its expected significant drop in energy requirement in comparison to commercial dredging vessels. Since, ALERD needs to dive and rise (contrary to surface vessels), and needs buoyancy compensation for the dredged soil, what these energy consumptions were, Junior Naval Architect Mathijs Bakker spent his internship at C-Job dealing with this topic. This number, together with previous energy determinations, turn into the total energy cost of ALERD which can be equally compared to conventional dredgers. In order to reach his goal, Mathijs first created a working model of the ALERD to simulate its behavior and motion control using MatLab and Simulink. The model contained a full dredging cycle which was created for the ALERD and was very similar to that of a conventional dredger. Performing the dredging cycle while maintaining zero trim and minimal undesired heave motions were the goal of the model. Disturbances were introduced in the model, such as the taking in a of dredging soil (sand) causing an unbalance in weight versus buoyancy, which then cause the submarine to sink. Similarly, small trim angles were introduced which were canceled out by moving of the ballast water, and likewise for balancing the buoyancy by adding or removing ballast water. The total amount of ballast water required to compensate all the motions and disturbances was analyzed by the motion controller inside the model, which resulted in an energy consumption afterwards. After running numerous tests with the model, the outcome could be combined with energy requirements for propulsion and dredging operations from previous studies, and the total was compared with the amount of energy a traditional dredger uses. The conclusion could be made that the ALERD could potentially decrease total energy requirements by as much as 66%, quite a significant percentage. This proves the ALERD's ability to do the same amount of work as a conventional dredger, at a much lower energy expenditure. Last year Mathijs finished his studies at the Delft University of Technology, and recently his research paper was published in a scientific journal with support from C-Job R&D Consultant Rolph Hijdra and TU Delft Associate Professor Andrea Coraddu. C-Job is keen on developing the concept even further and new research on this topic is already underway.

Soon you'll be able to buy the all-electric SUV here. or Subscribe to save article Share Australia is adding yet another car brand to its already overcrowded market in 2024. It's not just any brand though, it is the premium US marque, the self-described Standard of the World. It is, of course, Cadillac, which has never been officially sold in Australia, despite the fact its parent company, General Motors, once accounted for more than half of all our new car sales and once offered Chevrolets and Pontiacs alongside Holdens. Jess Bala, managing director of GM Australia and New Zealand, behind the wheel of a Cadillac Lyriq electric SUV. Australia will be the first country to receive the right-hand drive Lyriq. Cadillac will be first seen in Australia late next year, 122 years after the company was formed in Detroit, Michigan. And although it is renowned for its V8s, and even V16s, the brand will be 100 per cent electric here, according to Jess Bala, managing director of GM Australia and New Zealand. I think it's the right time to go for an all-EV brand, says Bala, given there's such a big transformation going globally, but in particular here in Australia and New Zealand, towards an all-electric future. Cadillac has already announced that globally we're going to be a fully electric portfolio by the end of the decade. So, obviously, some markets will have both ICE [internal combustion engine cars] and electric vehicles coexisting in the showroom, but here in Australia and New Zealand it will be solely an EV brand. Bala, an Australian, recently moved back to Melbourne after working on Cadillac's EV strategy in Detroit. Cadillac â€¦ is aspirational but obtainable â€¦ a bit of a reward to those individuals who have achieved something. â€” John Roth, vice-president, Global Cadillac She tells Life & Leisure that Cadillac's main drawcards are the very rich, 120-year history [with] a lot of innovation and the iconic American design. Whether it's the bold experience with that Cadillac DNA, the very high-end interiors with a lot of attention to detail â€¦ the Ultium EV platform, which is our modular architectureâ€¦ you combine all of that, and I think we have a huge competitive advantage globally, which is why you're seeing the expansion that Cadillac is going after presently. Bala says Cadillac is a true luxury entry where there's been no expense spared, and that it will line up confidently against the big three German luxury brands and newcomers such as Tesla. Advertisement But does today's average Australian even know what Cadillac stands for? Bala says market research shows the brand still has good cut-through. It's our job now to educate them as to the incredible cars that the brand has got coming, and why they are the right fit for the Australian customer and the market transformation that we've got going on here. First cab off the rank will be the Lyriq, an upmarket SUV that is slightly bigger than a BMW X5. It is a clean-sheet EV, built on the Ultium skateboard, which gives it a long wheelbase and a roomy interior (despite having the hallmark Cadillac long bonnet). Forget a pink Cadillac, go for a red one. Side view of the 2024 Cadillac Lyriq Sport trim with front grille illuminated. The Lyriq was launched in the United States last year with a rear-mounted motor developing 254 kW and 440 Nm, giving spritely performance and a claimed range exceeding 500 kilometres. A more powerful, two motor, all-wheel drive version is joining the range for 2024. Most importantly for us, the Lyriq will be built in right-hand drive, not converted after the fact, as is the case with some Chevrolets sold here. The Cadillac brand sells strongly in the US and China; the Australian launch is part of a concerted drive to increase volumes in other parts of the world. It's hard to be a global tier-one luxury brand without right-hand drive, John Roth, vice-president of Global Cadillac, tells us. So these vehicles, from the beginning of Lyriq, were designed to be right-hand drive right down to the component level â€¦ if you just look at that 33-inch screen in the vehicle, you'll notice that the curvature and the design of it allows it to sit on the left or the right-hand side of the vehicle by design. Roth says Australia will be the first country to receive the right-hand drive Lyriq. When asked what will make Australians buy Cadillacs, he says: It comes down to these words, we exist to drive big dreams and bold ambitions. Cadillac â€¦ is aspirational but obtainable â€¦ a bit of a reward to those individuals who have achieved something. Roth says Cadillac is working towards zero congestion, zero emissions, zero collisions though he can't at this stage confirm if Super Cruise , GM's acclaimed semi-autonomous driving system, will be available on our Lyriq. As for the car being at least a couple of years old when it arrives here, Roth says over-the-air updates mean it's constantly evolving and improving. The obvious question is: how committed is GM? It launched German brand Opel here in 2012 and gave up after a year, and there have been previous false starts for its premium US brand. Just before the global financial crisis, Cadillac signs were erected at Australian dealerships, and brochures printed. Yet after the first batch of 100-or-so right-hand drive cars left Detroit, the sudden change in the economy saw the cars diverted to New Zealand and quietly sold there. Is the launch definitively going to happen this time? Advertisement I never guarantee anything, Roth says with a laugh, before adding that now they have the right product and the right timing. With the new badge, a new sales model is planned. All selling will be direct to consumer, either online or through Cadillac Experience Stores, with the first three in Melbourne, Sydney and Auckland. Potential buyers can lodge expressions of interest at cadillacanz.com/register. Golden era of the 1940s and '50s In a curious twist of history, Cadillac emerged from the ashes of the failed Henry Ford Company. In 1909, Cadillac became part of the General Motors conglomerate, by which time Ford had regrouped with the Ford Motor Company and launched the Model T. Cadillac in a more expensive part of the market, having already forged a reputation for high quality and precision engineering. Components were interchangeable, which was highly unusual in those early hand-built days. The golden era for Cadillacs was the late 1940s and '50s, when they were bigger, more powerful and more lavishly equipped than almost anything else on the road. The brand pioneered tailfins (inspired by fighter jets) and they grew each year through the 1950s. With the so-called King Fin Caddie at the end of that decade, the tailfins rose to almost roof level. The Cadillac Lyriq SUV is nice and roomy inside. Even after tailfins lost favour, Cadillacs often included visual reminders of them in the taillights or rear bodywork. For the new Celestiq, a hand-built, Rolls-Royce-priced EV flagship, the designers have used lighting to bring tailfins to mind. Although visually distinctive and laden with luxury add-ons, the Cadillacs of the golden era tended to share a lot of their base mechanical parts with cheaper GM vehicles. By European standards, they were crude mechanically. And despite its The Standard of the World catchcry, the company has been remarkably insular, selling mainly in the US and more recently in China. Its most popular model in the US is often the Escalade, an upmarket version of a massive body-on-frame Chevrolet SUV with a pushrod, two-valves-per-cylinder V8. Executives now talk about The Renaissance, a remaking of the brand for international audiences based on thoroughly modern EVs such as the Lyriq and Celestiq.

Close Posted in Chips wars Nvidia dumbs down AI chips for Chinese markets Under the US chip ban, Nvidia can still ship some slower AI chips to China but they are not very competitive Click to print (Opens in new window) Nvidia plans to launch downgraded chips aimed at China. Image: Screengrab Nvidia has downgraded three graphic processing units (GPUs) for the Chinese markets after it was banned by the US government from shipping A800 and H800 chips to China last month. The California-based chipmaker is expected on Thursday to launch at least three new artificial intelligence (AI), the H20 L20, and L2, and perhaps more, to replace the banned processors, media reported. The performance density , or speed per die size, of the three chips is reduced to between 14.9% and 26.8% of that of the H100. Nvidia slowed their speeds with some hardware and software adjustments, according to technology experts. The H100 is 6.68 times faster than the H20, technology analyst Dylan Petal says in an article published by SemiAnalysis on November 9. However, the H20 is 20% faster than the H100 in large language model (LLM) reasoning, he added. LLMs are deep learning algorithms that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate content using very large datasets, according to Nvidia's website . Some Chinese firms had given up ordering Nvidia's AI chips as they did not know when and whether their orders would be canceled amid the United States' tightening chip export controls.

Latest stories Fusion power planners must allow for tech changes Baidu, China's search engine, had already ordered 1,600 Ascend 910B chips from Huawei for about 450 million yuan (US$61.83 million) in August and received about 1,000 of them, Reuters reported on November 7, citing two unnamed sources. One of the sources said the Ascend processors are now the most sophisticated AI chips available in China, although they are not as fast as Nvidia's. The H20's overall computing power is only equivalent to 20% of that of the H100, meaning that there is room for price cut, a Shanghai-based columnist writes in an article published on Monday. However, using the H20 will still be more costly than using China's AI chips, such as Huawei's 910B. The writer says Nvidia will lose its competitiveness in China over the long run if it cannot sell its most cutting-edge products in the country. New parameters In August last year, the Biden administration ordered US chipmakers to stop exporting graphic processors that operate at interconnect bandwidths of 600 gigabytes per second or above to China and Russia. Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips and AMD's MI250 chip are in the category affected by this rule. Nvidia later unveiled the A800 and H800 processors, which work at 400 and 300 gigabytes per second respectively, targeting the Chinese markets. Some analysts found that the A800 and H800 were actually reduced versions of the A100 and H100, respectively. On October 17, the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said it will not categorize restricted chips by using interconnect bandwidth as a parameter. Instead, it will use performance and performance density as new parameters. Under the new rules, a chip with a total processing performance of 4,800 or more or a performance density of 5.92 or more will be banned from being shipped to China. A800, H800, L40, L40S and RTX 4090 chips are in the category of this rule. China's orders involving US$5 billion worth of Nvidia chips have reportedly been canceled. As of now, the H20, L20 and L2 can still be exported to China as they fulfill the performance and performance-density requirements. But they are becoming unattractive to Chinese firms. A Beijing-based writer surnamed Huang in an article describes the H20, L20 and L2 as the castrated versions of the more advanced H100, AD102 and AD104 chips, respectively. Sign up for one of our free newsletters The Daily Report Start your day right with Asia Times' top stories AT Weekly Report A weekly roundup of Asia Times' most-read stories He says it's worth pointing out that the H20 is even slower than the entry-level A30 chip, which was launched in April 2021. The H100 is designed for graphics-intensive workloads while the A100 is designed for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workloads. The H100 is two times faster than the A100, which is also two times faster than the A30. Jiang Tao, a senior vice president of iFLYTEK, a Hefei-based AI solution provider, said on October 20 that the company uses Huawei's Ascend 910B chips for computing. Without providing data, he claimed that the chip has reached the benchmark of Nvidia A100. iFLYTEK has been unable to purchase American items since it was added to the entity list of the US in 2019. It was accused of supplying its surveillance equipment to Xinjiang camps that detain Uyghurs and other ethnic minority people. Follow Jeff Pao on Twitter at @jeffpao3 Like this: Like Loading...

Appuntamento il 14 novembre a Palazzo Mezzanotte (Milano), sede di Borsa Italiana, per i premi alle private bank, alle divisioni pb dei gruppi bancari, oltre che ai family office, agli avvocati, ai fiscalisti e agli altri advisor. L'obiettivo della rivista PRIVATE, sin dalla sua nascita, Ã¨ di seguire e raccontare tutta la filiera del private banking, settore con caratteristiche peculiari rispetto alle altre realtÃ  che si occupano di gestione e valorizzazione dei patrimoni familiari. Nel tempo sono cresciuti non solo i patrimoni in gestione, ma anche il numero di aziende che se ne occupano e i professionisti che gravitano intorno al settore, dando vita a un mondo che merita di essere raccontato. Nel corso della serata verranno premiati i principali protagonisti del mercato italiano relativo alla gestione dei grandi patrimoni e agli investimenti alternativi, nel corso una cena di gala alla quale prenderanno parte oltre 300 top manager delle principali realtÃ  italiane e internazionali. L'edizione 2023 prevede 29 riconoscimenti: dai banker alle private bank, dalle societÃ  di private equity ai family office, dai club deal alle realtÃ  specializzate negli investimenti crossborder, dagli advisor agli avvocati che operano nel settore, dagli specialisti degli investimenti alternativi alle societÃ  che maggiormente si sono distinte sul fronte dell'innovazione, sia It, che in termini di business model.

Joining the Ridgeline range is the TrailSport variant, which features off-road tuned suspension, all-terrain tyres and underbody protection made of steel. Suspension tuning for the Ridgeline TrailSport features spring rates, damper valve tuning and stabiliser bars unique to the TrailSport variant, which increase articulation while improving off-road ride quality without sacrificing on-road comfort and handling, says Honda. Powertrain for the Honda Ridgeline, as before is a 3.5 litre direct-injected VTEC V6 petrol engine that produces 280 hp and 355 Nm of torque sent through a nine-speed automatic, channeled to all four wheels via the i-VTM4 torque-vectoring AWD system that can send up to 70% of the engine's output to the rear wheels. Story continues after ad The all-terrain tyres for the Ridgeline TrailSport are General Grabber A/T Sport tyres measuring 245/60R18 for improved traction on dirt, sand, mud, rocky terrain and snow. Visually distinguishing the TrailSport from other variants of the Ridgeline include the new grille with a different mesh design, black door pillars and exterior mirror trim, and a black grille crossbar. The five-spoke, 18-inch alloy wheels are finished in Pewter Grey, and this colour is also applied to the front skid plate trim. â€˜TrailSport' badging in orange is applied to the grille and tailgate. Inside, the Ridgeline TrailSport cabin is identified by orange ambient lighting along with orange contrast stitching on the steering wheel, seats and door interior panels. The front seat headrests get embroiders â€˜TrailSport' logos which are also moulded into the floor mats. Standard on the TrailSport and other 2024 Honda Ridgeline variants is the Honda Sensing suite of driver assistance systems, consisting of collision mitigation braking system with forward collision warning, lane keeping assist, road departure mitigation with lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control; also included for all variants is the rear seatbelt reminder. Notable for its unibody construction as a pick-up model, the Honda Ridgeline touts a cargo payload capacity of 1,583 pounds (720 kg) and a towing capacity of 5,000 pounds (2.2 tonnes), and its cargo tray is made of glass fibre-reinforced SMC composite to resist dents and scratches without the need for a separate bed liner. Beneath the truck bed floor is the Ridgeline's signature lockable In-Bed Trunk that offers a further 7.3 cubic feet (207 litres) of secure storage space, and which can double as an ice-filled cooler, says Honda. The cargo bed itself can accommodate four-foot (1,129 mm) wide items in between the wheel wells, and features eight tie-down cleats rated for 350 pounds (158 kg). Its dual-action tailgate can extend the available length of bed from five feet, four inches (1,625 mm) to over seven feet (2,133 mm) when opened in the down position, where it can take dynamic loads of up to 300 pounds (136 kg), to handle a motorcycle or ATV. To be made available for the North American market, the 2024 Honda Ridgeline and Ridgeline Trailsport will be made at the automaker's plant in Lincoln, Alabama, and the unibody pick-up truck model will arrive in dealers in the northern hemisphere winter.

The Chinese lender's US arm was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted trades in the US Treasury market last week. World United States & Canada LockBit says it got ransom payment from ICBC over hack that hit US Treasury market The Chinese lender's US arm was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted trades in the US Treasury market last week LockBit has hacked some of the world's largest organisations in recent months, stealing and leaking sensitive data in cases where victims refused to pay ransom Why you can trust SCMP China's biggest lender, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, paid a ransom after it was hacked last week, a LockBit ransomware gang representative said on Monday in a statement which Reuters was unable to independently verify. ICBC, whose US arm was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted trades in the US Treasury market on November 9, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They paid a ransom, deal closed, the LockBit representative said via Tox, an online messaging app. The blackout at ICBC's US broker-dealer left it temporarily owing BNY Mellon US$9 billion, an amount many times larger than its net capital. The hack was so extensive that even corporate email at the firm ceased to function, forcing employees to switch to Google mail. The market is mostly back to normal now, said Zhiwei Ren, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. The ransomware attack came at a time of heightened worries about the resiliency of the US$26 trillion Treasury market, essential to the plumbing of global finance, and is likely to draw scrutiny from regulators. A spokesperson for the US Treasury Department did not immediately provide comment on Monday. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Centre, a financial industry cybersecurity group, said financial firms have well-established protocols for sharing information on such incidents. We are reminding members to stay current on all protective measures and patch critical vulnerabilities immediately, a spokesperson said in a statement, adding: Ransomware remains one of the top threat vectors facing the financial sector. LockBit has hacked some of the world's largest organisations in recent months, stealing and leaking sensitive data in cases where victims refused to pay ransom. In just three years, it has become the world's top ransomware threat, according to US officials. Nowhere has it been more disruptive than in the United States, hitting more than 1,700 American organisations in nearly every sector from financial services and food to schools, transport and government departments. Notorious ransomware gang accused of attack on UK's Royal Mail Authorities have long advised against paying ransomware gangs in a bid to break the criminals' business model. Ransom is usually demanded in the form of cryptocurrency, which is harder to trace and gives the receiver anonymity. Some companies have quietly paid up in a bid to get back online quickly and avoid the reputational damage of having their sensitive data publicly leaked. Victims who do not have digital backups that allow them to restore their systems without the need of a decryption key sometimes have no choice but to pay. Last week, LockBit hackers published internal data from aerospace giant Boeing and said on their website they had infected computer systems at law firm Allen & Overy. 3 ",negative,,EN,,,"2,34",HONG KONG,5833,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/14/0e64377a-7ff5-43d7-ae7c-056c0387aafc_8a54137a.jpg?itok=C34c9bmt&amp;v=1699923056,8103232,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2430969,0,0,N01,,,P

In New York City, Salon Art + Design's 12th edition was a certified showstopper. Save Article The 12th installment of Salon Art + Design , held once again at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City, drew more than 2,000 visitorsâ€”including the twins Olsen, Linda Fargo , and Colin King â€”on its opening night this past weekend. On display was a curated assortment of vintage, modern, and contemporary design and art presented by more than 50 influential exhibitors. Noteworthy sales were reported, featuring iconic pieces by the likes of Karl Springer and Carlo Bugatti. However, it was a number of distinctive works from independent galleries and showrooms that particularly caught our eye. Here, we highlight a few of our favorite discoveries from the exhibition. DeMuro Das DeMuro Das The New Delhiâ€“ and New York Cityâ€“based studio DeMuro Das , founded by Brian DeMuro and Puru Das, presented the LouLou, a contemporary spin (pun intended) on a classic lounge chair that sits on a swiveling base and was shown in a Dedar fabric with fringe by HoulÃ¨s. â€”Sean Santiago Gallery Fumi Jeremy Anderson Artist Jeremy R. Anderson shared a pair of lamps he cheekily dubbed his Uptown Ladies, in collaboration with London-based Gallery Fumi . They were inspired, according to Anderson's Instagram , by the stylish women of New York City who come to the Armory dressed in their finest. â€”S.S. Abask Abask This vintage 1970s silver snail ice bucket is one of many standout pieces on offer from the new British online design retailer Abask . Others from the brand's booth included a Josef Hoffmann sterling-and-lapis coffee service and a collection of throws by Studio Shamshiri. â€”Bebe Howorth Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Maison Gerard Niamh Barry Irish designer and artist Niamh Barry 's calling card is her monumental bronze light fixtures, but her latest, a chandelier comprising eight large components, is among her most complex. Inspired by the golden artifacts found in the Broighter Hoard in Ireland, the work manages to feel both weighty in its meaning and weightless in its proportions. â€”Helena Madden Galerie Chastel-MarÃ©chal Courtesy Galerie Chastel-MarÃ©chal Painter and sculptor Joy de Rohan Chabot , a longtime Dior Maison collaborator, showed off a series of new pieces with the Paris-based Galerie Chastel-MarÃ©chal . Nature motifs are frozen in delicate bronze, with golden flowers crisscrossing in the pair of cocktail tables and birds perching among the metallic leaves of the screen. â€”H.M.

The three new GW-B5600CD watches are the brand's latest collaboration with the Charles Darwin Foundation, an organization that engages in environmental conservation activities in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. The Charles Darwin Foundation is an international nonprofit organization committed to conserving the natural environment of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. The organization is involved in a range of activities, including surveying the GalÃ¡pagos Islands' marine and terrestrial life and ecosystems and promoting island nature conservation efforts. The latest collaboration model marks the second partnership between G-SHOCK and the Charles Darwin Foundation, following the first in 1999. The new GW-B5600CD shock-resistant watches feature designs incorporating silhouettes of creatures that live in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, along with the rich natural environments where they live. While based on the GW-B5600, a timepiece equipped with radio wave reception and Tough Solar charging capabilities, the new GW-B5600CD watches feature a bezel and band made with bio-based resin produced using renewable organic resources. Each of the three watches features a face with a unique design motif: a hammerhead shark in an ocean environment for the GW-B5600CD-1A2; a Darwin's finch amid the foliage of a Scalesia forest, one of its preferred habitats, for the GW-B5600CD-1A3; and a GalÃ¡pagos giant tortoise in a rocky location, one of its preferred habitats, for the GW-B5600CD-9. Silhouettes of each featured creature also appear on the LCD when the backlight is illuminated. The Charles Darwin Foundation logo is engraved on the case back, and a Spanish-language statement meaning I support GalÃ¡pagos conservation is printed on the band. A portion of the proceeds will be used to support the Charles Darwin Foundation's conservation activities.

From architectural icons to oases of calm elegance, here are six of the Qatari capital's hottest properties. Raffles Doha Doha's most dramatic new building houses not one but two design-driven hotels. Taking up one half of the scimitar-shaped Katara Towers, the all-suite Raffles Doha is an instant dazzler. From its 42-metre atrium that doubles as a giant kaleidoscope with constantly changing projections of clouds to the louche velvet-curtained Blue Cigar bar with its collection of 6,500 books including rare first editions, it's clear that this hotel aims to be different. Resembling a pair of crossed Qatari scimitars (that feature on the country's national crest), Doha's iconic Katara Towers are home to two hotels: The Fairmont and Raffles.Photo: Supplied Up in the suites, the mood is light and whimsical, enhanced by vaulted ceilings covered in reliefs of foliage and flowers, leather-fronted storage spaces that look like steamer trunks, and walk-in minibars enclosed within ornately carved wooden walls. Attention to detail is extraordinary here, from the small surprises â€“ monogrammed key cards, bowls of berries, sleep sprays â€“ that pop up during your stay, to the heated marble stands that keep towels fluffy and warm in the bathrooms. Don't miss breakfast in L'Artisan, a glorious light-filled space with soaring curved ceilings and cascading chandeliers that look as if they're made of icicles. Photo: Supplied The greatest design stories from AD Middle East, delivered to your inbox Arrow Fairmont Doha The Fairmont Doha , Raffles's sister hotel, resides in the other half of the Katara Towers Â­and, while it has a completely different design mood, it's no less dramatic. The atrium here is filled with more than 4,000 rain drop-shaped crystals that tumble down from the ceiling, lifts have twin benches so you can enjoy the ride in comfort, and public bathrooms are worth a peek for their individual design themes and intricate mosaics.

As big tech invests billions in a race to control the most powerful technology in the world, some of AI's inventors fear the future they've helped create. Jeremy Howard taught AI to the world and helped invent ChatGPT. He fears he's failed Share By technology reporter James Purtill for Science Friction Posted Tue 14 Nov 2023 at 7:00pm , updated 2 hours ago Wed 15 Nov 2023 at 2:20am Jeremy Howard has watched his vision for the AI future crumble, even as the technology has improved. (Supplied: Jeremy Howard) Help keep family & friends informed by sharing this article abc.net.au/news/jeremy-howard-taught-ai-to-the-world-and-helped-invent-chatgpt/103092474 Copy link Share In late 2017, Jeremy Howard was working on his couch in San Francisco, experimenting with a technology that would ultimately change the world and lead to tools like ChatGPT. Natural language processing (NLP) was one of the great challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) at the time. AI systems were generally bad at navigating sentences or paragraphs of languages other than computer code. Basically, they couldn't read and write. Loading... But the Melbourne-born tech entrepreneur and data scientist had an idea to solve this problem and, ultimately, give AI access to the vast store of recorded human knowledge. And that's exactly what's happened. Only five years later, the world got ChatGPT. AI models trained on the contents of the internet have become our magical writing and research tools. Some even believe these large language models (LLMs) show signs of human-level intelligence. And yet Mr Howard, who's credited with making an important contribution to NLP, worries his life's work is a failure. He's watched AI technology fall under the control of a few big companies. It's looking like we might have failed, he says. I feel like it's going to be even worse than we thought. The 'goosebumps' moment when AI learned to read So, back to late 2017. Mr Howard was on his couch, thinking about NLP. Recent advances had shown that machine learning AI systems trained on huge datasets of labelled images could become adept at recognising the objects in those images. He wondered if the same approach could work for reading and writing. Could an AI trained on billions of words learn the meaning of these words in various contexts? And so the really big bunch of words I picked was the entirety of English Wikipedia. That was about 3 billion words. Mr Howard trained a large language model (LLM) to predict every single word of Wikipedia, given the previous few sentences. It did this in a painstaking manner. It tried to predict the next word in a sentence, checked the answer against the database, and then, if the word was wrong, adjusted its mathematical understanding of the relationship between words. Then it repeated this process until it got the word right. Then it moved on to the next word. Soon, the model was predicting the right word about a third of the time. Was that good? Well, there was one way to find out. I picked the hardest and most well-studied task in the world of NLP at the time, which is to read an entire multi-thousand-word movie review and say whether it's a positive or a negative sentiment, Mr Howard says. Jeremy Howard has founded several tech companies, including the email provider Fastmail.(Supplied: Jeremy Howard) If the model had learned something about language, it should be able to say whether the reviews were good or bad. So he downloaded the entirety of the IMDb movie review database and set his pre-trained LLM to work, assessing whether a review was hot or not. And 10 minutes later, he was stunned. I thought there was something wrong because literally the first time it went through [the IMDb database] it said 93 per cent. The LLM was correctly inferring a review's sentiment 93 per cent of the time. I had goosebumps. I couldn't believe it. Quitting their jobs to share AI knowledge with the world It was a moment of wonder, followed by a gnawing sense of worry. For the past five years, Mr Howard and his wife, the computer scientist Rachel Thomas, had been watching the remarkable developments in machine learning with great interest and trepidation. They predicted this technology was going to take over the world and they were worried about who would control it. We thought this could be the most powerful technology in history and we should do everything we can to make sure that everybody can access it, Mr Howard says. In 2016, they sold their start-up companies and quit their jobs to co-found an online university, fast.ai, with a mission to democratise machine learning knowledge by providing online courses. This wasn't a money-making venture. In fact, for the past seven years, they've earned nothing from the courses. But they were excited about the future. Mr Howard was convinced AI was becoming truly intelligent. Loading... As a philosophy student at the University of Melbourne in the early '90s, he'd pondered whether a sophisticated enough machine could achieve human-level understanding. His conclusion? If it talks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Very early on, I was pretty convinced that if we could ever create an algorithm that could kind of ingest loads and loads and loads of text and find patterns in it, then it could appear to be an intelligent agent as far as humans are concerned. Now, in 2017, his work had come full circle. He'd built an algorithm that appeared intelligent from a human perspective. And soon, others took notice. A young PhD student in Ireland, Sebastian Ruder, watched a lecture on fast.ai where Mr Howard demonstrated how his Wikipedia-trained language model could analyse the sentiment of movie reviews. Dr Ruder, who's now a senior AI researcher at Google, recognised its importance. This was the first successful instance of transfer learning for modern language models I had seen, Dr Ruder says I realised this would have great potential. Transfer learning is where knowledge learned from a task (in this case, predicting the next word in Wikipedia) is re-used in order to boost performance on a related task (analysing the IMDb database) It's the technique that underpins the general-purpose abilities of ChatGPT and other modern AI language tools. Mr Howard and Dr Ruder worked together on validating and developing Mr Howard's initial approach and then submitted a co-authored paper that was published in the peer-reviewed journal ACL in May 2018 . It arrived just as the AI world was waking up to the power of LLMs. The rise of OpenAI and the rapid march to ChatGPT Mr Howard's couch-based NLP research showed that a language model trained on enough general text develops the ability to find patterns in this data, and understand the relationships between words. This pre-trained ability can then be used for other tasks (transfer learning). Google was working on a similar idea. In 2017 its researchers developed a novel network architecture called Transformer (it's now the final T in ChatGPT) and freely shared their results. Another company was poised to take advantage. OpenAI was a research-focused non-profit that was only three years old in 2018. In June of that year, it released its own language model, which used Google's Transformer architecture but also borrowed techniques from Mr Howard. OpenAI's model was called GPT. And yes, it's a direct ancestor of ChatGPT. In a blog post at the time, GPT's lead developer, Alec Radford, said it was partly inspired by Mr Howard's ULMFiT language model. Loading Twitter content Over the next few years, AI companies raced to scale up LLMs through training them on larger and larger training datasets. GPT was trained on 4.5 gigabytes of text, or about 7,000 books. GPT2, released in 2019, was trained on about 10 times tha",neutral,,EN,,,4,AUSTRALIA,1312,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/281fde3d60e9141288e8438ff4dfe9de?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=944&amp;cropW=1678&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=512&amp;width=862&amp;height=485,175438,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,52631,0,0,P00,,,P

Cookbooks from Leah Koenig, Giulia Scarpaleggia, and Saghar Setareh offer unique perspectives on Italian cuisine that go way beyond pizza, lasagna, and seaside spritzes. Email Lille Allen/Eater In the aftermath of the pandemic, travel media has become saturated with scenes from Italy. The perennial nature of this trend â€“ going strong since the Grand Tour of the seventeenth century â€“ demonstrates that plenty of people can never get enough of daydreaming about the Bel Paese. Some, however, have had more than enough . The recent polarization of Italy as a focus of travel and culinary media alike is self-perpetuating; the more Italy is flattened to a mere background for selfies, rom-coms, and television shows that center American celebrities, the more the culture and cuisine are flattened and falsified into a caricature of what they truly are. Though Italophiles working within and outside the country have made gains in raising awareness around regionality, there continues to be little recognition of the fact that Italy is a country with its own indigenous and immigrant populations. As a result, most so-called Italian food â€” decadent dishes of lasagna and truffle risotto â€” shown in the media is not the daily diet of Italy's residents, but the cuisine of Italy as performed for tourists. For this reason, we are all long overdue for the publication of three new cookbooks this year that draw us into the home pantries of Italians, rather than their restaurants. Written by three women with strong ties to Italy â€” one native, one immigrant, and one visitor â€” each offers a unique, intimate perspective of Italian cuisine that is defined not by arbitrary borders, but by culture. In their pages, you will find words in Italian and English, as well as Farsi and Yiddish, reflecting the diversity of those who shared this peninsula for millennia before the contemporary image of the Vespa-driving, Ferragamo-wearing, Moka-drinking Italian took hold. In this way, the authors transform the general understanding of Italy from an idyllic tourist destination for seaside spritzes and pizzas in piazzas to a nation shaped by the creativity and resiliency of its inhabitants. Giulia Scarpaleggia Artisan Books, April 2023 Giulia Scarpaleggia was born and raised in Tuscany, where she learned l'arte dell'arrangiarsi (the art of making do with what you've got) from her mother and grandmother. This art is at the heart of cucina povera, which Scarpaleggia translates as peasant food and defines as a way of cooking guided by seasonality, humble ingredients, and simple techniques that rely on the resourcefulness of home cooks. The first instruction always involves peering into your pantry and focusing on what you already have, rather than what you're missing â€” advice that doubles as a philosophical practice for life in general. Scarpaleggia's recipes are sourced not just from Tuscany, but from all over Italy in support of her belief that cucina povera is the foundation for all Italian food and, furthermore, representative of an approach to cooking that extends beyond the country's confines. In pairing recipes for canning fruit and repurposing bread with anecdotes from her childhood and historical context, Scarpaleggia educates readers about the origins of cucina povera, which came from times of hardship and hunger. Many of the dishes are naturally vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, waste-free, and seasonal out of economic necessity, not as a result of dietary trends. For this reason, there is something for everyone in this collection of approachable, affordable, and sustainable dishes. The photographer â€” Scarpaleggia's husband, Tommaso Galli â€“â€”creates a convivial atmosphere for readers to join Scarpaleggia on a discovery of lesser-known Italian foods as she introduces, for example, a recipe for elderflower fritters where one might instead expect to find tiramisu. With her inviting words and his enchanting photography, one wants to eat whatever is set on their table. Saghar Setareh Interlink Books, June 2023 At the outset of her first cookbook, Saghar Setareh, a native of Iran who has been living in Italy for nearly two decades, explains that its contents are neither nostalgic about the â€˜exotic Persia,' nor in search of â€˜dolce vita' in Italy, but simply living and breathing both, and everything in between. This is, in fact, how the recipes are organized, divided into chapters titled â€˜Iran, In Between, and Italy.' (In Between being defined as Jordan, Syria, Cyprus, Turkey, and Greece with the assistance of a map that shows the expanse of land where the region meets the Mediterranean.) Pomegranates & Artichokes draws on the duality of Setareh's own identity as an Iranian immigrant in Italy, but people from all walks of life will be able to relate to this book, which is more broadly about the migrations of ingredients, of recipes and of stories â€” but most importantly, of people. Through her recipes, Setareh takes us on a journey that follows her own travels between the two places she calls home, a journey made all the more enjoyable thanks to the addition of her own photography, which is rich with color and texture, and characterized by an artist's eye for the striking contrast between light and dark. Each chapter is accompanied by an exploration of the ingredients commonly found in the pantries of those living in Iran, Italy, or the countries between them, from saffron and pomegranate molasses to tahini and orange blossom water to anchovies and balsamic vinegar. Setareh's utmost hope, however, is to highlight the similarities between the recipes and stories, rather than the differences. In exploring the far-reaching affection for ingredients such as the eggplant, she creates a sense of empathy and community that illuminates how profoundly Italian culinary traditions have been influenced by cultural exchanges with neighboring nations and immigrants. Leah Koenig W.W. Norton & Company, August 2023 Like Setareh, Leah Koenig's first formative encounter with Italy occurred in Rome at the age of 22, and Portico, like Pomegranates & Artichokes, discusses migration patterns in Italy. However, while Setareh's recipes span several countries, the recipes of Koenig's cookbook are rooted in a small, specific space within the Italian capital: the Jewish Ghetto. The title of the cookbook is a reference to the long-standing structure that forms the entrance of the Ghetto, which Koenig interprets as a symbol of welcoming and a testament to the resilience of the Jewish people who have resided in Rome for thousands of years. Portico celebrates the distinct Roman Jewish cuisine that developed here over time, honoring historic traditions together with modern reimaginations and recipes that are admittedly influenced by Koenig's self-described American sensibilities. Many recipes are directly credited to current inhabitants of the Ghetto, whose portraits appear alongside scenes of the neighborhood taken by photographer Kristin Teig, conveying a palpable liveliness that resonates with Koenig's stories. With an introduction to the essential components of the Jewish Roman pantry and detailed menu suggestions for major Jewish holidays, Portico is a source of inspiration for daily living as well as special occasions, and a rare point of reference for this particular culinary tradition that is both its own and a part of Italian food culture.

Iscriviti HIMACS: Milan Design Week Sparkle Krib Sparkle Krib by Karim Rashid Anche quest'anno in occasione della Milano Design Week (8-13 aprile) Superstudio Group organizza il Temporary Museum for New Design, l'evento piÃ¹ esclusivo e importante del circuito del Fuorisalone. Un appuntamento da non perdere all'insegna della progettazione, della ricerca, della qualitÃ  materica, della tecnologia e dell'innovazione. Superstudio PiÃ¹, in via Tortona 27, Ã¨ la location privata piÃ¹ grande di Milano nonchÃ© quella che ha affermato la zona come polo di riferimento in occasione di fiere ed eventi d'arte, design e fashion, un luogo iconico di grande prestigio e fascino, celebre a livello internazionale. Il Temporary Museum, per l'edizione 2014, si arricchisce di numerosi progetti speciali. Il fil rouge che collega le varie proposte Ã¨ quello dell'innovazione, dell'immaginazione, dell'originalitÃ  e della qualitÃ , tanto sul piano delle idee quanto su quello della realizzazione. In questo contesto, anche LX Hausys, leader mondiale in ambito tecnologico, prende parte all'evento e presenta un concetto sospeso tra realtÃ  e immaginazione, intessendo le linee di un progetto autentico e visionario. Lo spazio abitativo proposto da LX Hausys, un'esclusiva installazione nata dalla collaborazione con Karim Rashid, designer eclettico, vede HIMACS, la Pietra Acrilica di Nuova Generazione, come protagonista indiscussa, in una declinazione di colori, energia e creativitÃ  dal ricercato valore sia artistico sia architettonico. Sparkle Krib: libertÃ  d'immaginazione Il progetto di questo â€˜appartamento' soprendente prende il nome di Sparkle Krib (da sparkle, scintillio e crib, casa), uno studio sulla potenza visiva delle linee sinuose e soprattutto dei colori, e il cui concept si presenta come un suggestivo inno alla dualitÃ  della materia, tra idealismo e pragmatismo. La creativitÃ  si esprime tramite elementi inseriti armoniosamente in uno spazio dalle linee organiche e fluide, come in movimento: arredi semplici ed essenziali, ma di grande personalitÃ , con un'impronta progettuale e tecnologica innovativa, futuristica. Lo spazio prende forma attraverso l'uso sapiente di HIMACS, del quale evidenzia ed enfatizza le straordinarie potenzialitÃ  materiche e tecniche, che esprimono al meglio il concetto di â€˜libertÃ  d'immaginazione'. La Pietra Acrilica di Nuova Generazione, infatti, grazie alla sua struttura duttile e semplice da lavorare, si presta per natura ad accogliere con facilitÃ  la fantasia di architetti e designer, concretizzandola nelle sue piÃ¹ svariate forme e idee, anche le piÃ¹ ambiziose. Assieme ad HIMACS, in favore dello spazio concettuale, Karim Rashid utilizza anche parte della restante gamma di prodotti LX Hausys, tra I quail Deco-foil, Floors e Automotive Skin, tutti accomunati da una spiccata qualitÃ  materica, specialistica e prestazionale. Le caratteristiche di termoformabilitÃ  e traslucenza proprie di HIMACS si rivelano ancora una volta perfette per la realizzazione di uno spazio accogliente rivolto al futuro, un ambiente che, pur visionario, si riesce a percepire come personale. L'open space interno abbraccia i visitatori e dona loro un'esperienza sensoriale irripetibile, dove vista e tatto si armonizzano in un unico orizzonte emozionale. I confini tra immaginazione e realtÃ , cucina e soggiorno, living e notte, sono impalpabili, cancellati per sottolineare la potenza della mente, priva di ogni ostacolo e ogni limite. Sparkle Krib raccontata da Karim Rashid HIMACS di LX Hausys ha dichiarato Karim Rashid mi permette di creare progetti fluidi in Solid Surface che mostrino un mondo senza linee e senza confini. Le pareti dello spazio di LX Hausys sono, infatti, in bilico tra il liquido e il solido. CiÃ² che ne risulta Ã¨ un insieme di forme organiche che di volta in volta, morbidamente, si trasformano in, o nascono da, superfici lisce e bidimensionali. L'emozione complessiva che ne scaturisce Ã¨ un senso di infinitÃ , un'esperienza effimera ma intensa, eterea e continua. Ho progettato lo spazio LX Hausys per portare gioia e piacere, non pesantezza, e per stimolare il senso di coinvolgimento attraverso la disarmante bellezza dell'ambiente. Il pubblico puÃ² interagire con questo mondo inanimato e identificarsi con esso, come fosse un'estensione delle proprie emozioni e del suo essere fisico. Lo spazio LX Hausys abbraccia tutte le necessitÃ  di una casa contemporanea, combinando alle linee fluide anche numerosi aspetti tecnologici. La TV OLED, presente nell'installazione, parla di un mondo piÃ¹ flessibile e lo mostra malleabile, fluido. In questo senso, Ã¨ come se rendesse la tecnologia piÃ¹ amichevole, piÃ¹ vicina a noi, come fosse un'estensione dei nostri stessi corpi, dei nostri ambienti tecno-organici. L'approccio olistico nei confronti dello spazio pieno dimostra come le nostre vite si possano elevare quando sperimentano la bellezza, il comfort, il lusso, le alte prestazioni, l'eleganza, la tecnologia e le utility, specie se tutte contemporaneamente. I nostri ambienti domestici hanno una vera e propria relazione con noi, emotivamente, socialmente e psicosomaticamente. Gli spazi e gli oggetti giocano con i nostri comportamenti e li condizionano, dettano il modo in cui viviamo, in cui interagiamo, il modus operandi delle nostre azioni. Se cambiamo i nostri oggetti, quindi, cambiamo il nostro mondo. Cambiando i nostri ambienti cambiamo i nostri comportamenti sociali. Secondo questo pensiero Ã¨ possibile creare un mondo migliore attraverso il design. Sparkle Krib Ã¨ uno spazio abitativo di 130 mq, realizzato con la mia collezione HIMACS Sparkle Collection, oltre agli altri materiali LX Hausys come Deco-foil, Interior Film e Automotive Skin.

La stagione autunnale, infatti, porta con sÃ© anche un gran numero di allergeni. I residui vegetali delle foglie cadute possono penetrare negli occhi, provocando un riflesso di ipersensibilitÃ  del sistema immunitario, provocando allergie. Ãˆ importante proteggere gli occhi da allergie e da altri disturbi riducendo al minimo le spiacevoli allergie autunnali. Ma, quali sono le strategie da adottare per prevenire i fastidi, salvaguardando la salute dei propri occhi e vivere al meglio la stagione autunnale? ðŸ Usare occhiali da vista invece che le lenti; ðŸ Evitare di toccarsi troppo gli occhi; ðŸ Osservare una corretta igiene Avete domande?

Matt LeBlanc pens bittersweet tribute to friend, Matthew Perry By GMA Integrated News Published November 15, 2023 5:51am Actor Matt LeBlanc has posted a tribute and heartfelt farewell to the late Matthew Perry, his co-star in the hit TV series Friends. Matthew. It is with a heavy heart I say goodbye. The times we had together are honestly among the favorite times of my life, LeBlanc posted in his Instagram account. It was an honor to share the stage with you and to call you my friend. I will always smile when I think of you and I'll never forget you. Never, he added. The social media post included photos of the two actors in various scenes they shared in the popular sitcom including photos showed Joey Tribiani, played by LeBlanc, and Chandler Bing, played by Perry hugging each other. The last photo is a group hug with the other Friends co-stars Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, and Lisa Kudrow. The TV series first aired in 1994 and ran for 10 straight seasons. The cast reunited in a nostalgic special as the cast relieved episodes, personal trivia, and even had a re-reading of an episode on HBO in 2021. It ended in 2004, with a finale that was watched by some 52 million Americans. LeBlanc ended his message in typical Joey Tribiani fashion, saying, Spread your wings and fly brother you're finally free. Much love. And I guess you're keeping the 20 bucks you owe me, he added. â€” BAP, GMA Integrated News ",positive,,EN,,,"3,21",PHILIPPINES,2269,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,"https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2023/11/Matt_LeBlanc,_Matthew_Perry_in_hit_TV_series_Friends_2023_11_15_05_49_10.jpg",1071322,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,321396,0,0,N00,,,P
1221916999,WOLFSTREET.COM,11/15/2023,WEB,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://wolfstreet.com/2023/11/14/beneath-the-skin-of-cpi-inflation/,Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation | Wolf Street,"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation | Wolf Street Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation by Wolf Richter â€¢ By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET . Energy prices plunged, durable goods prices (cars, electronics, furniture, etc.) dropped, food prices rose moderately, as some food prices dropped and meat prices jumped, according to the Consumer Price Index data released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the action was in services, and has been for a long time. The CPI for Rent inflation â€“ actual rents that tenants are paying â€“ re-accelerated for the third month in a row, motor vehicle insurance spiked, lots of services jumped, but airline fares, rental cars, and some other services fell. And the odious health insurance adjustment, which is part of services, reversed, as expected. It had caused the health insurance CPI to collapse by nearly 4% month-to-month every month for 12 months through September, and finally by 37% year-over-year, after the pandemic healthcare distortions had spectacularly blown up the model the BLS had used to estimate health insurance costs. Now the health insurance CPI went the other way, as expected, and jumped month-to-month, and will jump month-to-month for the next six months under a newly tweaked system â€“ and the jumps will get bigger. I just shredded the whole thing here: The Collapse of the Health Insurance CPI (How it Became Chickenshit) . The Overall CPI, month-to-month, inched up by 0.04% in October, after having jumped by 0.40% in September, and by 0.63% in August. In October, it was pushed down by the 5.5% month-to-month plunge in energy and the drop in durable goods. As you can see, this jumps up and down a lot: August had been the biggest month-to-month increase since June 2022; October was the smallest increase since July 2022 (blue line). The three-month average, which irons out the month-to-month ups and downs, rose by 0.36%, or 4.4% annualized, with October and September values being the biggest increases since November 2022: Core CPI, month-to-month rose by 0.23% in October from September, a slower increase than in the prior month, pushed down by the drop in durable goods, and helped by the moderate month-to-month rise in core services (blue line). The three-month moving average rose by 0.28%, the biggest increase since June (red): The year-over-year CPI decelerated to 3.2%, after three months in a row of re-acceleration, pushed down by the drop in energy prices and durable goods prices, and the 34% plunge in the health insurance CPI, and helped along by slower increases in food prices (green line). The year-over-year Core CPI rose by 4.0% year-over-year, pushed down by the drop in durable goods, and the 34% plunge in the health insurance CPI (red line): Core services still hot, rents smoke. The CPI for core services (without energy services) on a month-to-month basis rose 0.34% in October from September, or 4.2% annualized, a lower rate, after three months of re-acceleration, including the 0.57% jump in the prior month (7.06% annualized), which had been the biggest increase since February (gray line). The three-month moving average, which smoothens out these month-to-month ups and downs rose by 0.43% in October, roughly the same increase as in September, or 5.3% annualized (red line): Year-over-year, the core services CPI rose by a still red-hot 5.5%, despite the 34% collapse of the year-over-year health insurance CPI within it: The Rent of primary residence CPI further accelerated to +0.50% in October (+6.2% annualized), the biggest increase since April. The Rent CPI is based on actual rents that tenants actually paid. The survey follows the same large group of rental houses and apartments over time and tracks what tenants, who come and go, actually pay in these units. The huge month-to-month spikes in rent in 2022 through February 2023 are behind us. But after cooling a lot in the first half of 2023, increases of actual rents have begun to accelerate again. Year-over-year, the Rent CPI increased by 7.2% (red in the chart below). Over the past three months, the month-to-month rent CPI has run at an annualized rate of over 6%. This 6%-plus increase also roughly matches what the largest landlords have reported in their earnings calls. So it seems rent increases have gotten stuck at the 6%-plus rate. The Owners' equivalent of rent CPI rose by 0.41% in October from September (or 5.0% annualized), after 0.56% jump in the prior month, which had been the biggest increase since February. The OER index is not based on actual rents, but on what a large group of homeowners estimates their home would rent for. Year-over-year, the CPI for OER increased by 6.8% (green): Asking rentsâ€¦ The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) and other private-sector rent indices track asking rents, which are advertised rents of vacant units on the market. Because rentals don't turn over that much, the ZORI's spike in 2021 through mid-2022 never fully made it into the CPI indices because not many people actually ended up paying those spiking asking rents. In late 2022, asking rents in dollar-terms began to dip seasonally, but then began to rise again this year to new records in dollar-terms. This time of the year, the ZORI typically dips a little. And in October it dipped by $1.91 from the prior month (-0.09%), to $2,011.22. The decline was smaller than in October last year (-$2.58 or -0.13%). The chart shows the CPI Rent (green, left scale) as index values, not percent change; and the ZORI in dollars (red, right scale). The left and right axes are set so that they both increase each by 55% from January 2017, with the ZORI up by 47% and the CPI Rent up by 34%: Rent inflation vs. home-price inflation: The red line represents the CPI for Rent of Primary Residence (tracking actual rents). The purple line represents the Case-Shiller Home Price 20-Cities Composite Index. Both lines are index values set to 100 for January 2000: The collapse of the health insurance CPI. October was the first month without the monthly push-down adjustments to the health insurance CPI, which started with the October CPI in 2022 and went through September this year. I discussed the old and new versions earlier today, shredding the whole thing: The Collapse of the Health Insurance CPI (How it Became Chickenshit) . I'll just say here that the health insurance CPI jumped by 1.1% in October from September, instead of plunging 4% month-to-month, as it had done in the prior months; and that the new version of this index is smoothened via a moving average, so the impact of the new positive values is slowed by the moving average, but should get picked up over the next months; it might rise by about 2% in November and by about 3% in December, my rough guess. Here is the infamous chart of the Health Insurance CPI as index values, and that little hook at the bottom is the 1.1% increase that will increase over the next few months (this chart shows how the index has turned to chickenshit , technical term): Services CPI by category. The table is sorted by weight of each service category in the overall CPI. The CPI for medical services is the third largest item, with a weight of 6.3% in overall CPI, and over 10% in the services CPI. The year-over-year drop of 2.0% â€” though actual expenses medical care services have risen â€“ was caused by 34% year-over-year collapse of the health insurance CPI within it. Note the spike in motor vehicle insurance. Major Services without Energy ",positive,,EN,,,"4,98",ZIMBABWE,467,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,,39098,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,11729,0,0,P00,,,P

This charity is like family to me and has been by my side through all the highs and lows as well as providing amazing opportunities for my dancers over the years. Dancing is what I do, but being a self taught choreographer it's came as a really challenge to learn the Argintine Tango, dancing this way does not come naturally to me and trust me my a dance partner Lauren has had a huge challenge on her hands, but I wanted to take on the challenge, push myself and most importantly raise some funds for this amazing charity.

1221917137,WWW.REDDIT.COM,11/14/2023,REDDIT,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/dmtguide/comments/17vc9ps/i_tested_8_cartridge_models_from_4_brands_ccell/,r/dmtguide,"r/dmtguide I tested 8 cartridge models from 4 brands (CCELL, SPRK, O2Vape, Ispire) to find out which is the best for vaping DMT. If you're not interested in getting into the weeds and just want my top pick, it's O2vape's Variflow Ceramic Cell cart, wide version. Their model names are similar so it's the one with the fluted (curved) mouthpiece - it's the one on the far right in the photo. Yes it's more expensive than other carts but you'll get many reuses out of it so it's well worth it in the long run IMO. \--- For all of these tests I'm using 50/50 PG mixtures. Battery generally at 2.8V. You shouldn't experience any harsh burnt sensations if product is good, voltage is properly set, and cart is of high quality. The inspiration for this post was my disappointment in the ccell TH2 that is widely recommended in this subreddit. I know a lot of folks love it, and if it works for you that's awesome. It just isn't my fave. It may not be obvious why I'm including some of the categories. Here's why: **Airflow** Airflow is important when vaping DMT because the more cool air moving through the cart the less likely the spice will burn and the less work the lungs are doing to pull air through. **Included silicone caps?** It's important to remove the cart from battery and cover both ends of the cart when not in use to increase shelf life. Some brands include caps and some don't. Here's data on each cart I tested, in order of most to least favorite: Safe travels! â€‹ * **O2 Vape variable airflow ceramic cell wide version** (fluted mouthpiece) * Airflow: Highest of any cart I've tried. Super smooth easy hits. * Glass is thicker than any other cart. This thing is sturdy. * Anecdotal reviews say lasts more than 5 refills. * Price: $11.45 * Only downside is it only comes with bottom cap, no cap for the top for storage so you may have to use a spare from an old cart. * **O2vape - same model as above but non-wide version**. * Basically the same but slightly less airflow and thinner glass. Same price. Works great. * **O2vape variable air flow all glass** * Airflow: really good * Included silicone caps * Good for 6 refills according to user reviews * Some condensation ends up in the center tube which means you're losing some product. * Durability - haven't broken one but it's all glass so... * Careful screwing and unscrewing, it's a more complicated assembly that can accidentally come apart if you're not paying attention when removing the cart from the battery. * Price - $10 * **iSprie Ducore X** * Airflow: less than O2vape but still good. * Included silicone caps * Manufacturer says not reusable however user reviews say good for 3 fills. * Because this is a thicc boi it may not fit some pens. * No need to get the variable airflow version, it does not add any airflow * Price: $5.50 * **iSpire Ducore S** * Similar to points above, just feels a little lower quality but gets the job done. Good airflow. * Price $5.50 * **SPRK Ceramic 2** (tried both metal and ceramic colors) * Only good thing about these is they have decent airflow. * But avoid at all costs because they often leak and it's a huge mess. * Bottom cap included * Advertised as reusable * Price: $2.95 * **SPRK Ceramic 3** * These also leak, avoid at all costs. * Not only do they leak but the airflow is worse than their predecessor. * No caps included. * Advertised as reusable * Price: $3.50 * **Ccell TH2** * Airflow: Terrible * Have had burnt coils on multiple carts. * Not advertised as reusable but people often get a few refills out of them. * Price: $5.00 Other general notes: Some people say you have to prime the coil (let the liquid sit in the cart) for 24 hrs before taking your first hit to prevent burning the coil. This is not the case for the Ispire or O2vape. I waited about 30 min and they were good to go. Can't speak for the others because I let them them sit for 24 hours assuming I had to. If you have any other favorite carts or questions about these ones let me know. I'll try to keep this updated as I gather more data. Quick note on batteries: * My favorite battery is the Yocan Kodo Pro. It's cheap and feature packed. * What to look for in a battery: * Voltage option at least as low at 2.8V. Ideally fine tune adjustable so you can dial in your setup. * If you're aiming for a breakthrough level hit, find a battery with a long cut-off time (how long it takes for the battery to auto-turn off when taking a long hit) most Yocan batteries have a 15 second cutoff which means you can go as long as 15 seconds before re-pressing the button to continue your hit. https://preview.redd.it/ytzwrycfnd0c1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e8ac3bad53fa239445d4975dd043b0538b96382",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,200,7,0,0,0,7,0,N,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9--JHEHrUGE0KxukxTaMuEjtGlJ2blXAdALVVW1s19M.jpg,66465,r/dmtguide,AssumptionOrdinary18,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,19939,0,0,P00,,,P

Modi will be the first PM to visit Ulihatu, the tribal icon's birthplace. The yatra will start from districts with significant tribal population initially and by January 25, 2024, will cover all districts across the country. The yatra, with 3,000 vans, will go on for two months and cover 2.5 lakh gram panchayats and 15,000 urban locations in the country. Each van will stay in a gram panchayat for two hours, in an attempt to reach out to any potential beneficiaries who have been left out of government schemes and ensure they are covered by the same. The main target is the lower and middle-class population and to ensure they get benefits of schemes if they have been left out for some reason. Till November 22, 393 tribal blocks in 69 districts in 21 states/UTs and 9,000 gram panchayats will be covered. Following that, the yatra will pan out to other rural areas as well as urban areas. Chief Ministers, Union and state ministers and Governors will be present at various locations during the yatra. In poll-bound states, the yatra will begin after conclusion of the model code of conduct. A total of 118 vans will be flagged off on November 15. The PM mentioned about his Jharkhand visit during a rally in Madhya Pradesh on Monday. These are the last days of the elections, but after two days, I will go to the village of Birsa Mundaâ€¦these are our priorities, the PM has said. The PM will also transfer the 15th instalment amount of about Rs 18,000 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) to more than 8 crore beneficiaries. FOCUS ON TRIBALS In a huge step to empower tribals, the PM will also launch the PM PVTG (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups) Development Mission in the village of Birsa Munda on Wednesday. In a first-of-its-kind mission, since Independence, the Modi government will launch a Rs 24,000 crore scheme to ensure holistic development of PVTGs on the occasion of the Jan Jaatiya Gaurav Divas. In the budget of 2023-24, the launch of Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission was announced to improve socio-economic conditions of the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). There are 75 PVTGs in 18 States and UTs living in 22,544 villages having a population of around 28 lakh. These tribes stay in scattered, remote & inaccessible habitations, often in forest areas and hence a mission is planned to saturate PVTG families and habitations with basic facilities such as road and telecom connectivity, electricity, safe housing, clean drinking water and sanitation, improved access to education, health and nutrition and sustainable livelihood opportunities, a government source said. The mission will be implemented through convergence of 11 interventions of nine ministries, for instance, under PMGSY, PMGAY, Jal Jeevan Mission etc. Some scheme norms will be relaxed to cover these remote habitations. In addition, separately, saturation will be ensured for PMJAY, Sickle Cell Disease Elimination, TB Elimination, 100% immunisation, PM Surakshit Matritva Yojana, PM Matru Vandana Yojana, PM Poshan, PM Jan Dhan Yojana etc, officials said.

INNN and Schnitzel spend an hour arguing about various Bayern Munich related topics. Email Photo by Christian Kaspar-Bartke/Bundesliga/Bundesliga Collection via Getty Images As Bayern Munich enter another international break, one player has shone brighter than the rest. Harry Kane is a phenomenon â€” he has 17 goals in 11 Bundesliga matchdays, surpassing the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Gerd MÃ¼ller. This has people talking, but that's not the only major thing that has taken place in the last week or so. FCB youth player Aleksandar PavloviÄ‡ made his starting XI debut, and Thomas Tuchel has picked a fight with the German media. In this episode, INNN and Schnitzel discuss the following: Is Harry Kane already a better striker than Robert Lewandowski? What would it take for Kane to surpass Lewandowski's legacy at Bayern Munich? Is a Ballon d'Or on the cards for Harry Kane? Switching gears â€” INNN argues that Thomas Tuchel has managed to do a few things better than Julian Nagelsmann did. How would Nagelsmann have fared with Harry Kane? What could Nagelsmann have planned for Germany in this international break? Is it time for Joshua Kimmich to move back to right-back? Does Germany need a new striker?

I have recently done my open water diver certification. I have not done any fun dives after that. While doing the course, they made me buy a mask and a snorkel. Now I want to complete my snorkelling system and want to use it when I'm not diving. At this point, I want to invest in fins. I have done some research and here are the few things which I found till now: * If snorkelling fins are used in diving, they won't work well in currents. * If diving fins are used in snorkelling, there is more fatigue (extra length and weight). * Snorkelling fins are mostly closed heel, while diving ones are open heel. I also found out that *Mares Avanti Quattro Plus* has been around for years and are considered all rounders. But I also found out that those are open heels (bungee strap). And open heel requires boot. If I go with this model, will I need a diving boot for snorkelling? Do I need diving boots when diving using a fin which has bungee strap? Let's ignore the cold water and security from the aquatic animals for now. Should I buy snorkelling fins only and depend on rental ones which they give in fun diving. Or the one which can handle both? Which one? Or should I have 2 sets of fins.",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,389,23,0,0,0,23,0,N,,,148520,r/scuba,psycosmogrammer,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,44556,0,0,P00,,,P

Next time you see one, please pop in. It will inspire new questions around #sustainability and greenwashing. You may also want to double-check their website for further information about their commitment to conduct their business ethically and responsibly. Let's say #scope1, and #scope2. Among the products that built their reputation worldwide: a self stirring mug, a spin of bottle game, a shot belt, and a banana shaped pencil bag. It is quite easy to consider all this the result of a Scandinavian plastic masturbatory hallucination. From a scope 3 perspective, you may wonder whether you really need any of these items in the first place, and what will happen once you realize you really don't need them but you bought them. For the latter, along a famous Scandinavian fast fashion brand, the chain has no answer. But for the former you can always buy their wonderful REUSE REDUCE DANCE RECYCLE REPEAT tote bag, and leave their shop happily. A nice example of #greenwashing. For more, follow me on Linkedin.

I'm looking for the best vehicle for sleeping, light-moderate off-roading, light towing (a uhaul trailer with some furniture or a small pop-up), good performance in snowy and desert climates, good daily driver, good safety ratings. Should we keep looking at this make and model or do you recommend anything else? I'm moving to either New England or out west in a few months for work. My wife and I like to get a camper van a few times a year and just drive through mountains until we find a place we want to sleep. We also like buying antiques for our house while we're on adventures. The houses we're looking at are all remote so we'll have to battle snowy, hilly roads in winter. A lot of SUVs are one demonsional. They'll excel at one thing but fail at others. I want the best all-around option. 80% of the time my vehicle will only need to do regular city and highway driving. I test drove a Wilderness and it was a decent experience. I like the interior layout. I like the back seats laying entirely flat. I was surprised by the acceleration and the turn radius. I hate the infotainment with a passion. Why are there shift paddles if it's CVT? I read when I got home that it has ASS but I didn't notice it so maybe I was distracted. Anyway, we figure this is the kind of vehicle where we fall in love when we find ourselves in a situation that it was designed to handle.

Compressor cases, made by case manufacturer Ervin Piquerez S.A. (EPSA) were a very popular trend in the 60's used by brands like JLC, UG, Longines(their re-issue Legend Diver copies the layout). This runs a LIP Calibre R184. One of the first(along with the Accutron) mass produced and reliable 'electronic' movement(pre quartz) and the first with a date function. It wasn't any more accurate than a half decent mechanical as it still used a balance wheel running at 5hz(unlike the 360hz Accutron). The Nautic-Ski was first produced in the early 60's with a mechanical movement to exploit the rise of both recreational diving and skiing(which is apparently quite a 'wet' pursuit). In 1965/6 they installed the electronic movement making it among the first such dive watch(Bulova's Accutron 666 was a little later iirc). Members of Jacques Cousteau's dive team wore them. As did many in the French yachting fraternity. The first edition of the electronic Nautic-Ski had a black dial, this version came along in '68 with a dial designed by French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, using not unnaturally the colours of the French flag. This colourway lasted well into the mid 70's(in larger cases). ",positive,,EN,,,3,UNKNOWN,64,1,0,0,0,1,0,N,,,16193,r/VintageWatches,MrGrentch,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,4857,0,0,P00,,,P

Hi there! Reddit has been very intent on showing me posts from the COS subreddit. After seeing quite a few cool designs, I went into the wiki and looked up all the creatures. I especially enjoyed that on the wiki there are also development photos and concept art, but it has me scratching my head. â€‹ Are there any of the COS here, or somewhere I can message, to talk about how the models are made? In some development photos, the models seems to be 1 seamless creature, but in the final renders, or test renders, there seem to be 'pieces' of the creature. Seeing that this is Robux? I'm guessing the creatures are in fact 'in pieces'. Such as, instead of a seamless model, there are in 'blocks'. A neck could be 5 different rectangular pieces, squished together. â€‹ Are all the models started as a seamless creature and them 'split'? or are they initially modeled in pieces already? Am I imagining things? How does this affect your textures, or are they painted by face vs a texture map? Lots of questions! I love the models. I love the low poly look, but also appreciate how detailed some of the creatures are. In school, our teachers would reprimand us for shoving pieces into one another rather than making them seamless, which is probably why im extra fascinated with the art style here. And how does that effect rigging and animation? I know this is probably hard to answer, if any dev/artists are even here. If not, then I'ld like to let everyone know that I love what I'm seeing - though I've heard its not beginner friendly. I was hoping it could be played solo. so I guess ill just lurk and enjoy all the designs and colour schemes :)",positive,,EN,,,3,UNKNOWN,33,1,0,0,0,1,0,N,,,7054,r/CreaturesofSonaria,RampagingElks,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2116,0,0,P00,,,P

Another way of viewing this is essentially that person(parent) is left compelled to abandon all of their previous traditions and leave themselves subject to what is an externalised framework of ideological fast fashion. I think often about what this means downstream. from the rather innocuous ramifications of this ideological premise in the micro expression of it, of say not cutting their boys hair short, is symbolically the same as shaving it off, leaving them a blank slate with no identity inprinted on them from their immediate environment. So where else will they find their culture and tradition? Isn't this act of castrating yourselves culturally inevitably putting it into the hands of a newspaper, a magazine, A tv show, a politician , easily manipulatable and incredibly vunrable to the whims of external ideologies? This is why I am drawn to the framing of it as ideological fast fashion, an inversion where it leaves their identity the same as their parents, which often manifests as a surface level aesthetic birthed from a basic contrarianism. It leaves a society very susceptible to being lifted up of of all its grounding, repolarised to a modality of the prevailing power or narratives preference but in a way that leaves the population still atomised to each other. Fluid, and unable to solidify cohesively, simply because they have been gaslit into viewing the passing down of tradition, a product of immense complexity fermented through a long period of natural selection, as taboo, resulting in you being reconstituted into a society constucted of simple carbohydrates and sugars with its shape having the facsade of complexity but simplex in its structure and easily manipulatable. This leaves in my head a weird metaphor, of a society not being fed on a sourdough bread fermented through millennia, its recipe a long process of trial an error, and of natural selection, of a sustainable hardy complexity, one not of top down imposition that is now mistook for, and in its place a society fed peter pan paint, with a structure and consistency not of their making but leaving them the privilege to shape it into facade , an aesthetic that is essentially baron underneath its surface level. Of a society that has thrown a coat handed down through generations that has weathered a malenia into a fire and has donned a costume bought from a store, one that comes in a thousand different styles, but built to last no more than a season, one that has been marketed to be mistook as your own creation because you had the privilege of choosing its shape and colour through the illusion of choice, but not of your own design or making, the loom of culture having being transported from the home and into a factory, with its populace fooled into thinking the exact opposite is happening.",positive,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,716,5,0,0,0,5,0,N,,,308289,r/JordanPeterson,ozkah,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,92486,0,0,P00,,,P

This is especially important if you share the vehicle with other drivers. * Heating Function: In cold weather, make use of the mirror heating feature to prevent ice and fog buildup, which can obstruct your view. * Indicator Lights: Ensure that the indicator lights on the wing mirrors are functioning correctly.

I should know, I performed His autopsy It began with a black bag over my head. Six or seven men seizing me off the street on my way home from work, holding me at gunpoint in the back of a van. They explained in detail what would happen to my family if I didn't listen to them. Until that moment torture was just a word. I had never given it much thought. I wasn't prepared to hear some of the things they told me. By the time they were loading me onto a helicopter I would have done anything they asked. I arrived at the blacksite, kicked out of the chopper where my feet hit the hard-packed wet mud with a splash. Black hood torn off so hard it hurt the skin on the tip of my nose and then I got my first look at the place. Can't say if it met my expectations or not. I didn't have any idea where I was going, or what it was supposed to look like when I got there. Still, it managed to leave me feeling surprised. An abandoned village nestled in the jungle. Mostly one room hovels, lots of corrugated iron. Here and there lay burned allotments. Dying pepper plants left untended, their fruit stamped into the Earth by the passage of soldiers dressed in all black. Rotten fences and troughs to feed long-dead pigs and goats lay smashed to pieces. And then, lurking on a hill like some architectural jumpscare was a three story hospital made of glass and steel. State of the art. Built in a place where tarmac was just a rumour. Officially it had been put there by a charitable non-profit wanting to research novel diseases and potential cures deep in the jungle. Unofficially, it had always belonged to the CIA. A useful place to test strange things with pox in the name. And, when the time came, a useful place to dissect the impossible. Imagine my surprise when I was escorted by armed men to an office with my name on the door and discovered that I was to be in charge of its latest major project. *Head of Research* printed on the glass*.* Real official looking. Big black letters like I'd always worked there. First thing I thought was, *How long do they intend to keep me here!?* But that didn't last long. That hospital became my home and has been ever since. Less than 24 hours after my arrival and I had my feet up on the desk, barking orders at lab technicians. I slipped into the role easier than I'd like to admit. You see, where they got me was on scientific curiosity. That's how they ensured I was on board with the project. That's why they never pointed a gun at me after day one. They didn't have to. The second I saw that thing inside the messiah's chest cavity, I was a willing asset. No more *me*. Only the project. The discovery and the revelations. Lying on that slab, nestled in the flesh of an otherwise normal looking man, was a white hot piece of divinity. A pin prick in the fabric of reality. I don't know how else to describe it. It was like I'd spent my whole life seeing two-dimensional shadows and then I suddenly got a glimpse of the three-dimensional shapes casting them. I haven't seen my children since they took me. Couldn't tell you their names. I was never the same after the first autopsy. No one in that place was sane after the scalpel first bit into His flesh. Attrition amongst the research staff was incredibly high. Every day another nurse seized by stigmata, or a once-faithless lab technician struck by the call to write the Third Testament. The guards dealt with the unwilling members of the team. Traumatised scientists and clinicians lined up, one by one, against an exposed brick wall in the jungle heat and shot. I remember smoking in the cafeteria in between surgeries, nervously shaking as I tried to ignore the *pop pop pop* of some of my more stubborn colleagues being executed. And then back to work where I suppressed the feeling that I was the worst kind of traitor. Next day there'd be new faces scrubbing up and asking for orders, another pair of hands shipped in from God-knows-where. Back to cataloguing divinity. At times I imagined joining the objectors. The people who found religion in a sterile black ops lab. But that *thing* we pulled out of him, that baffling enigma that burned the eyes. It consumed the project. Everything we learned about it felt like a quantum leap in our understanding of microbiology. We tested everything we could get our hands on. Plants. Animals. Humans. I tried not to look any of them in the eye. Quiet people taken from some quiet part of the Earth where they wouldn't be missed. All of them scared. Did they know? I mean *really* know the suffering they were in for? Definitely not. They expected to be shot, I imagine. Not to wake up with the roof of their mouths lined with eyeballs. I'm ashamed to say but those kinds of results invigorated me. Excited me, even. When it all fell apart and I missed the evacuation, I got to finally rifle through all those classified documents where I discovered I hadn't been selected because I was some genius of microbiology. But rather because my psychological profile made it clear I'd do anything if you dangled a big enough mystery in front of me. That and the fact that I was actually quite good at managing projects. Geniuses usually aren't great at sending out memos or keeping track of performance numbers. Thankfully, I'm no genius. It was humbling at times, working with some of the guys down below, being senior to them even. I mean Dr Coates was probably the smartest man I'd ever met. No real academic career because he had a habit of hyperfixating on things that either couldn't be solved, or which no one gave a shit about. But it was pretty clear this was a guy who could've turned his brain to just about anything and made a name for himself if he was just a little more on the ball. He was an odd'un, basically. Gave lectures barefoot. Would respond to last-minute marking deadlines by giving every student a B. Threw a stapler at the head of his department. That kind of thing. Intelligent but not particularly sensible. The project broke him. Broke his worldview. Broke his mind and, towards the end, even his body. You might think the problem was asking a hyper-rational man to process the divine, but if anything he processed it a little too well. He was the first person to read The Third Testament without going insane. Immediately insane, I should say. Or maybe he was always nuts to begin with. Either way, he managed to take all the random scribbles and bits of verse that we'd collected from the personal effects of the deceased and actually put it together into a single document. Then he read it and came out looking like nothing special had happened. The next guy after him, not so lucky. But Dr Coates, he carried on working for a few days after. Took measurements of this. Made recordings of that. Slipped into the background, out of my notice, while I focused on trying to figure out some way of getting The Third Testament scanned into a computer without it causing havoc. A lot like the people who read it, machines liked to commit suicide about half-way through reading the Third Testament. Not Coates though. He seemed just fineâ€¦ Should've known better. First clue that something wasn't quite right was when I went to his office. A cramped space with metal walls and floors, no windows given it was below ground, and a countertop full of equipment. It was always a mess in there and usually a bit smelly too, but it was usually just that unwashed scientist smell. But one day when I went to call on him he opened the door and I got a whiff of something that was justâ€¦ wrong. Smelled a little like death, only not quite. Just, *different*. Mouldy, almost. Course he was entitled to do some experiments on his own time, and that's what I figured it was. At the time, I wrote it off. Had other things on my mind. Only the smell got worse with time. Turned up day after day and each time it stung my nose a little worse, hung around my sinus",negative,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,23771,26,0,0,0,26,0,N,,,17858971,r/nosleep,ChristianWallis,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,5357691,0,0,N00,,,P

Toggle navigation How one gastroenterology practice uses hybrid virtual care to improve patient experience Hybrid collaboration enables multidisciplinary care, standardized outcome measurement and more streamlined care delivery, its CEO says. Dr. George N. Pavlou, gastroenterologist and president and CEO of Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey Photo: Dr. George N. Pavlou Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey needed to optimize care and capacity: Reimbursement gets tighter every year while patient demand grows. The practice aims to improve access for necessary in-person care and procedures while offering patients complementary proven interventions ideally suited for telemedicine. THE PROBLEM Gastroenterology is a complex specialty, said Dr. George N. Pavlou, gastroenterologist and president and CEO of Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey. We diagnose and treat dozens of diseases of the digestive tract, liver and pancreas, as well as provide essential screening procedures for early detection of colorectal cancer. Like so many specialties, GI is facing a huge backlog of preventive care and deferred screenings as well as treating patients to achieve and maintain remission, he continued. Our eight advanced practice providers are seeing patients all day; our 42 gastroenterologists are caring for patients all day and after hours. Meanwhile, the operations of the practice handles a daily flood of patient messages, insurance and prior authorization requests, and coordination of appointments and follow-ups. A large percentage of patients come to us with functional gastrointestinal disorders [FGIDs], also known as disorders of the gut-brain interaction [DGBIs], Pavlou explained. These are cyclical issues caused by atypical functioning of the digestive tract rather than a structural problem or infection. They cause a host of symptoms that can be debilitating, greatly impacting all aspects of a patient's life and wellbeing. Treating these patients requires a customized management plan and frequent touchpoints to guide patients through dietary and behavioral changes, he said. The reality is that few GI practices, even a sophisticated high-quality practice like ours, are structured or staffed to provide high-touch dietary and behavioral interventions. Most, if not all, patients with chronic GI conditions benefit from these conservative yet proven interventions, he added. Frequent touchpoints with a registered dietitian or a GI psychologist are easier to deliver via telehealth , much to patients' convenience, Pavlou noted. The interplay between the brain and the gut is something to be unpacked through dialogue, education and response â€“ to help patients understand and manage the effects of foods, stress, anxiety, depression and sleep on their GI health. This can make a huge difference between flare and remission of any chronic GI condition. Patients come to us for answers, and especially for patients dealing with DGBIs and functional overlap for organic conditions, we need to have more to offer them â€“ especially with complicated diets and behavioral health interventions that are almost impossible to figure out without specialized clinicians, he said. PROPOSAL A virtual multidisciplinary GI care partnership is an extension of our practice â€“ ideally suited to deliver the interventions that will improve our patients' lives and outcomes, Pavlou said. Hybrid virtual care is also well-suited to support care plan iteration and compliance, to answer patient questions as they arise, and to coordinate care with providers outside of our practice. Our goal is to surround our patients with a multidisciplinary care team in pursuit of achieving true control over their symptoms, he continued. Symptom control can avoid disease escalation, and this model has data supporting a reduction in avoidable surgery and emergency room utilization . This not only provides a significant benefit to the patient but benefits the larger health system and improves the experience for our gastroenterologists as well. Pavlou said staff know their health system can be difficult to navigate, so they also aim to alleviate the feeling that patients need to quarterback their own care. Lastly, we also know an activated, empowered patient is more likely to keep up with preventative screening procedures â€“ creating a virtuous patient referral pipeline into our practice, he said. Colorectal and esophageal cancer is treatable with early detection. MARKETPLACE There are many vendors of telemedicine technology and services on the health IT market today. Healthcare IT News published a special report highlighting many of these vendors with detailed descriptions of their products. Click here to read the special report. MEETING THE CHALLENGE Dietary interventions are especially well-suited to digital health, where people can have more frequent check-ins with a registered dietitian and share analytics on food and symptom tracking that is very cumbersome to do in an in-person format, Pavlou explained. Anyone who's tried to change their diet knows how hard it can be, he said. And for people with digestive health issues, diets can be incredibly restrictive and difficult to implement and maintain. One common dietary intervention used in gastroenterology is the low FODMAP diet, which eliminates â€“ and then reintroduces â€“ a broad category of foods likely to cause GI symptoms and can be a difficult diet to pursue alone. Working with a registered dietitian allows patients to quickly identify triggers and shift gears to different therapies if this particular diet doesn't work, he noted. Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey also sees patients with considerable anxiety associated with their GI conditions â€“ which of course makes symptoms worse. Working with psychologists and therapists who are specially trained in GI conditions and gut-brain interventions is critical, but access to these specialists locally is rare â€“ and usually comes with a high out-of-pocket burden for patients, Pavlou said. Giving patients the best of virtual and in-person care is supported by two-way information exchange, he continued. Co-managed patient care is achieved through EHR and health information exchanges, as well as more traditional means of collaboration like provider-to-provider calls where discussion is warranted. This hybrid model has a purpose-built commitment to data sharing and integration. RESULTS The endpoints the practice is measuring are aspects already proven: access, patient outcomes and enhanced care, Pavlou explained. Beyond scaling access to care, hybrid virtual care will bring wider value to our medical group to optimize practice capacity and support operational excellence by focusing on what happens between visits, he said. In gastroenterology, where access and cost have become the focus of health plans, hybrid collaboration enables multidisciplinary care, standardized outcome measurement and an exemplary patient experience. We will be measuring all of these metrics and believe the impact on our patients' lives will differentiate our practice, he added. ADVICE FOR OTHERS In this time of ever-growing patient demand and overburdened clinical practices, I advocate that assessing and negotiating the right partnerships with digitally enabled virtual care clinics needs to be a core competency for the next generation of medical group leaders, Pavlou advised. Geography, subspecialty access, payment models and clinician culture are all factors they must take into account when determining the right model for hybrid partnerships.

Sarah Bernstein won the Scotiabank Giller Prize in a 30th anniversary bash upended by anti-Israel protesters. Sarah Bernstein wins $100K Scotiabank Giller Prize in gala upended by protest Share: Nicole Thompson, The Associated Press Published Monday, November 13, 2023 1:40PM EST Last Updated Tuesday, November 14, 2023 10:28AM EST Montreal-born Sarah Bernstein won the Scotiabank Giller Prize in a 30th anniversary bash upended by anti-Israel protesters Monday night, when the usually staid gala was crashed by a handful of agitators. The Scotland-based author of Study for Obedience accepted the $100,000 award remotely from her home in the Highlands, where she had a baby just 10 days ago. Just as her name was called at the Toronto gala, a protester posing as a photographer interrupted the live telecast with antiwar slogans. Police escorted the protester out of a star-studded ballroom, with guests including Margaret Atwood, Vincent Lam and host Rick Mercer. The CBC broadcast kept the cameras off the incident for the viewers at home. Police said several people were taken into custody, but there was no word on charges late Monday. Bernstein's win was announced again and in an acceptance speech delivered via video call, Bernstein did not acknowledge protests that also included an interruption earlier in the night. Instead, she stressed the importance of storytelling. I'm really privileged to have been afforded the opportunity to tell this story, Bernstein said. I think ... how important it is, now more than ever, to support writers in material ways who tell stories of their own people in their own ways, especially when their stories challenge dominant historical narratives. The celebrations were also briefly halted early in the broadcast when several protesters jumped onstage, carrying signs that read Scotiabank Funds Genocide. They were quickly escorted out by police. Pro-Palestinian groups have taken issue with Scotiabank's investment in Elbit Systems Ltd., an Israeli arms firm. Jurors lauded Bernstein's novel, published by Knopf Canada, as an incandescent modernist experiment. The book is a short, absurdist novel light on plot. In it, a young woman tells her story of moving to a remote country to serve as her brother's housekeeper. But despite her brother's high standing, she is reviled in his town and comes to be blamed for a series of tragedies that befall local animals. Through the book, which is also shortlisted for the United Kingdom's Booker Prize, Bernstein explores questions of power, oppression and deference. The novel is Bernstein's second. The first, The Coming Bad Days, was published in 2021 to little fanfare. In addition to her career as a novelist, Bernstein teaches creative writing and literature at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. The Giller awards $100,000 annually to the author of the best Canadian novel, graphic novel or short story collection published in English. This year's runners up are Eleanor Catton for Birnam Wood, Kevin Chong for The Double Life of Benson Yu, Dionne Irving for The Islands: Stories and CS Richardson for All the Colour in the World. Each receives $10,000. The award was first handed out in 1994, a year after the death of its namesake, literary journalist Doris Giller. Her husband, Jack Rabinovitch, founded the prize to further Giller's legacy. Like his wife, he sought to uplift Canadian literature with a heady dose of glitz and glamour. Jack wanted to make it big and sparkly, said Elana Rabinovitch, his daughter, who serves as executive director of the Scotiabank Giller Prize. To some extent, it still kind of is. That accrues to the benefit of the authors. That's what we want to give them, is more attention and time and exposure and the limelight. In the three decades since its founding, the Giller has become something of a CanLit kingmaker. Winners invariably see a bump in sales, as do those who make the short and long lists, Rabinovitch said. The phenomenon has become known as the Giller Effect. The list of past winners is venerable, and includes such names as Atwood, who won in 1996 for Alias Grace, Alice Munro, who took home the prize in 1998 and again in 2004, Michael Ondaatje, who was recognized for Anil's Ghost in 2000 and Esi Edugyan, who received the award in both 2011 and 2018. The award is such a fixture of the CanLit canon that in 2014, Carleton University introduced a course all about it. Rosemarie Hoey designed and taught the seminar starting in 2014, inviting students to consider both the award-winning books and the prize's role in Canadian publishing. It's big business, said Hoey, who's now retired. I'm sorry if that rattles the chains of some of the purists, but my God, writers have a tough enough job, often working full-time jobs teaching or shovelling French fries.

Advertisement Updated: November 15, 2023 8:01 am IST Chhath Puja 2023 will begin on November 17 and conclude on November 20. The auspicious four-day festival of Chhath Puja is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal. This year, the festival will begin on November 17 and conclude on November 20. The holy festival is dedicated to the Sun God, the ultimate source of energy and life. On this day, women perform the morning puja by standing in a water body and offering water to the Sun and Chhathi Maiyya, believed to be the Sun's sister. According to the Hindu calendar, Chhath celebrations begin with Nahay Khay (bathing and feasting) on the first day, followed by Kharna on the second day, then Chhath Puja on the third day, and Usha Arghya on Saptami Tithi, which is the fourth and the last day. To perform the four-day-long puja one would need many items. Therefore, it's crucial that one gathers all the things in advance as missing even a single item in Chhath Puja is considered inauspicious. Here's a list of materials that are required for the Chhath Puja rituals - New clothes for the entire house, especially the person who is fasting.

By establishing a baseline measurement of soil carbon content and regularly monitoring changes over time, farmers can make informed decisions to enhance carbon sequestration in their fields. Through the collection of representative soil samples and laboratory analysis, the percentage of carbon in the soil can be determined, providing essential data for sustainable agricultural practices. #CarbonSync #RegenerativeAgriculture #NetZero #CarbonCredits #NaturalCapitalAccounting #Scope3 #HolisticManagement #CarbonFarmingProjectDeveloper #SoilCarbonTesting ",positive,,EN,,,9,UNKNOWN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://extreme-img-rep.web-live.it/storage/2023/11/15/0D9CD53E817623632D8DB9666C344B03B5F95DD2E3328CEC12CC1025A760792C.jpg,0,59624607462,59624607462{59624607462},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,P00,,,P

Guest column: Stubble trouble: Why pin blame on farmers for policy failures? By Nov 15, 2023 07:32 AM IST Share Via Copy Link It is claimed that the government agencies in Punjab have failed to effectively control the burning of paddy straw despite repeated directives from judicial authorities Farmers are again being blamed for the poor air quality in the national capital region. Though various factors contribute to the smog in Delhi and its neighbouring areas, the burning of paddy residue in Punjab, Haryana, and parts of western Uttar Pradesh is considered the primary reason. It is claimed that the government agencies in Punjab have failed to effectively control the burning of paddy straw despite repeated directives from judicial authorities. The withdrawal of the minimum support price (MSP) is proposed as a solution by some to discourage paddy cultivation and address the straw management problem. The area under paddy cultivation has increased to 3 million hectares in Punjab this year, with an estimated production of over 20 million tonnes of straw in the state (HT File Photo) The area under paddy cultivation has increased to 3 million hectares in Punjab this year, with an estimated production of over 20 million tonnes of straw in the state. Such an amount of straw is produced year after year. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Storage blues Managing such a vast amount of material in 3-4 weeks to ensure the timely sowing of rabi crops, especially wheat, poses a significant recurring challenge for farmers. The farmers understand the financial and environmental consequences of burning straws and put in their best efforts and resources for their timely disposal. They, however, are concerned about the storage of these substantial quantities and its costs. Only about 20-25% of the straw is used in various processes and as fuel by the industries, and the remaining increases the worries and anxieties of the farmers. Due to its high silica content, paddy straw is not used as animal feed, and researchers have not yet developed paddy varieties with lower silica content. The absence of a solution to this crucial issue is a matter of concern. It is perhaps due to insufficient attention and funding for agricultural research. It is thus imperative to redirect research and development efforts to address this problem, benefiting the farmers and society. Building policy synergy The government has formulated policies to facilitate timely collection, baling, and disposal of residue by providing subsidies for machinery and equipment required to hasten these processes. Despite farmers' enthusiastic adoption of these machines with substantial public investment, the problem persists. The farmers are still constrained to burn paddy residue to secure their livelihoods and prepare for the next crop. The policy of offering financial assistance to farmers for equipment purchases does not address the issues of limited storage space and associated costs. It also does not guarantee the consumption of the collected and baled material. Currently, no policies or investment plans exist to promote industries that can utilise or consume paddy straw in a significant way, leaving farmers hopeless with a surplus of unwanted material. Some experts and policymakers suggest diversification of agriculture as an alternative to reducing the area under paddy cultivation. It is surely a legitimate progressive option, as the present agriculture operations in Punjab are becoming increasingly unsustainable. However, notwithstanding the vociferous claims and suggestions by the government, much is yet to happen in agriculture diversification. There is a lack of synergy among different sectoral policies, and the agriculture policies have failed to make alternative crops attractive and remunerative for the farmers. Marketing of alternative crops vital The marketing of alternative crops is a major issue for which no viable solution has emerged to wean farmers away from paddy cultivation. Economists and policymakers often debate the continuation of MSP, but marketing-linked incentives are not discussed as forcefully as these should be to encourage farmers to shift to alternative crops. The MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy should continue. The governments should, however, work out a package of incentives for the marketing of alternative crops, ensuring pragmatic and realistic solutions to the issues emerging from paddy cultivation. Farmers resort to burning paddy straw out of helplessness and despair, a predicament that often goes unrecognised and unappreciated by the policymakers. The judicial authorities have also not yet fully appreciated the gravity of this situation. The existing policies are inadequate and fail to integrate effectively with other sectoral policies necessary for a comprehensive response to this problem. Needed: A more inclusive, cohesive solution The government should follow a holistic approach, considering the imperatives of agriculture, food, industry, environment, economic, and fiscal policies. The relevant government agencies should devise a more inclusive, cohesive, and practical solution rather than relying on ad hoc measures and handouts, which are unlikely to yield long-term results. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand that paddy cultivation is here to stay for the foreseeable future, given the imperatives of national food security and increasing global food demand. More substantial efforts should focus on research and development of low-water-consumption varieties of paddy with reduced silica content in the straw. The research could offer a more sustainable solution than merely providing temporary assistance to farmers for a problem that runs deeper than surface-level discussions. Insinuating or penalising farmers would only exacerbate social unrest in a state grappling with many other challenges. In the interim, the provision of paddy straw management costs along with the MSP should be compensated as an incentive to those farmers who do not burn it.

Hard-up Argentines, tightening their purse strings with inflation topping 140%, are increasingly turning to second-hand clothing markets, both to find affordable apparel and raise extra cash from selling old garments. By Miguel Lo Bianco and Claudia Martini November 13, 202310:00 PM UTCUpdated ago [1/2]People shop in a used clothing shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina May 14, 2019. Picture taken May 14, 2019. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights BUENOS AIRES, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Hard-up Argentines, tightening their purse strings with inflation topping 140%, are increasingly turning to second-hand clothing markets, both to find affordable apparel and raise extra cash from selling old garments. The South American nation, the region's No. 2 economy and a major grains exporter, is facing its worst crisis in decades. Two-fifths of people live in poverty and a looming recession is shaking up Argentina's presidential election run-off next Sunday. Rising voter anger is propelling a radical outsider, Javier Milei, the slight favorite in polls on the presidential election to beat Economy Minister Sergio Massa, the candidate of the ruling Peronist coalition, whose bid has been hobbled by his failure to rein in rising prices. You can't just go to the mall and buy something you like as you did before. Today prices are unthinkable, said Aylen Chiclana, a 22-year-old student in Buenos Aires. New jeans cost more than double the price a year ago, representing over one-third of Argentina's monthly minimum wage. Annualized inflation hit 142.7% in October, the country's statistics office said on Monday, with the monthly rise landing at 8.3%, although that was down from peaks in August and September and below analyst forecasts. Argentina has for years battled high inflation, which economists blame on money printing and an entrenched lack of confidence in the local peso. Inflation has accelerated over the last year to its highest since 1991. Beatriz Lauricio, a 62-year-old semi-retired teacher, said that she and her husband, a bus company employee, go on weekends to a clothing fair to sell old garments to make ends meet. We're middle class, lower middle class, I would say. We have our jobs but we need to come to the fair, she said, adding that when it was canceled one weekend due to bad weather the couple's finances collapsed. We're not doing this as a little extra so we can go on vacation to Brazil, we do it out of daily necessity, Lauricio said. MarÃ­a Silvina Perasso, the organizer of the clothing fair in Tigre, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, said many people shop there because prices have risen far faster than salaries. The local monthly minimum wage is 132,000 pesos, $377 at the official exchange rate but half that at real street rates due to capital controls - restrictions on foreign exchange transactions. With the economy the way it is, they buy clothes at 5% or 10% of the value that comes from a store and they can buy things for their families, she said. MarÃ­a Teresa Ortiz, a 68-year-old retiree, lives off her pension and from casual sewing work, which pays her 400 pesos an hour, officially about a dollar. She goes to the fair to be able to afford clothes she otherwise couldn't buy. We simply can't buy new things. You can't buy new sneakers, you can't buy new flip-flops, you can't buy new jeans, you can't buy a shirt or a T-shirt either. So you have to look for them at the fairs, she said.

The commission has asked the Congress leader to explain the statement by November 16 by 8:00 pm, as to why appropriate action for violation of the model code of conduct (MCC) as well as provisions of election and penal laws should not be taken against her. The notice from the Elections Commission came following a complaint filed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to the poll body that while addressing a public rally at Sanwer Assembly Constituency in Madhya Pradesh, she made unverified and false statements in respect of PM Narendra Modi that have the potential to mislead the public and tarnish the image of PM. You are hereby called upon to explain your statement made against star campaigner of another National Party and to show cause by 2000 hrs of 16th November 2023 as to why appropriate action for violation of Model Code of Conduct should not be taken against you, the poll body said in the notice issued to Priyanka. The ECI further said that clause 2 of Part I 'General Conduct'of Model Code of Conduct for the guidance of Political Parties and Candidates' provides--Criticism of other political parties, when made, shall be confined to their policies and programme, past record and work. Parties and Candidates shall refrain from criticism of all aspects of private life, not connected with the public activities of the leaders or workers of other parties. Criticism of other parties or their workers based on unverified allegations or distortion shall be avoided. Other parties or their workers shall not be criticised based on unverified allegations or distortions, it added. Notably, also the Supreme Court, in the Guruji Shrihari Baliram Jivatode vs Vithalrao case (1969) held that the political history of even countries like England shows that sensational false election propaganda against a political party, particularly on the eve of an election might upset the party's electoral fortune. But the advantage gained from free criticism--though sometimes it may turn out to be irresponsible--in the long run outweighs the disadvantages. Earlier on November 8, Addressing a rally in support of Congress candidates in Sanwer in the Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh, senior Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has handed over government companies to his industrialist friends. Modi ji, the BHEL from which we used to get employment and the country was moving forward, what did you do with this? To whom did you give it? Why did you give this to your industrialist friends? Priyanka Gandhi said. The poll commission also said that whereas, the public generally believes that the statements made by the senior leader that too of a star campaigner of a national party, are true, it is expected that such a leader is privy to and possesses a factual base of the statements made by him/her.

UK Sikhs feel uneasy and overlooked after Canada killing James PHEBY 15 November 2023 at 4:48 am Â·4-min read Expatriate Sikhs are concerned about India's crackdown on the separatist Khalistan movement (Oli SCARFF) Britain's Sikh population, whose ancestors first migrated from the Punjab more than a century ago, have long been admired as a model of integration and for maintaining a strong identity. Lauded in their country of origin and beyond for their valour, industriousness and charity, Sikhs took those values to Britain, which during the country's imperial past praised them as a martial race. ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement They won accolades for standing up to rioters in London in 2011, for charity work during the coronavirus pandemic, and most recently for feeding the hungry during the cost-of-living crisis. We don't often complain, Jas Singh, adviser to the Sikh Federation UK, which represents some 500,000 Sikhs in the UK, told AFP at the Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Smethwick, near Birmingham in central England. But the tight-knit community is now appealing for help to address long-term issues such as racism and a lack of representation in politics and culture. We still need help just like everybody else, said Kulbinder Kaur Gakhal, an education administrator at the Smethwick gurdwara, one of the oldest and largest in Europe. The fact that we only have two Sikh MPs. Given our numbers, we should have maybe six or seven. Across the civil service, there's very low Sikh representation -- in the police, in education, added Jas Singh. This is a wall of discrimination that we face, he added. Despite official figures showing a 169 percent rise in attacks on Sikhs in 2021/22, there is no approved definition for anti-Sikh hate crimes in the UK. - Fresh worries - A statue outside the gurdwara paying tribute to the many Sikhs who fought with the UK in the world wars is frequently vandalised, said Gakhal. They have security cameras and information that's led them to know who's done it. But the authorities aren't able to pinpoint, so it's a shame, she added. But it is an Indian crackdown on the Khalistan movement, which wants an independent Sikh state in India, and its wider global fallout that has left many in the community particularly concerned. New Delhi has banned the movement as a security threat and taken a particular interest in those close to Amritpal Singh, a firebrand Sikh leader who was arrested in April in India after a month-long manhunt. In February, hundreds of his supporters, some carrying swords and guns, had pushed past barricades outside a police station near Amritsar, demanding the release of an aide held inside. Protests were held around the world over the manhunt, including in London, where Avtar Singh Khanda -- a friend of Amritpal Singh -- was accused by Indian media of pulling down an Indian flag. The 35-year-old activist, who was never named by UK police as a suspect, died on June 15 after suddenly falling ill with blood cancer. His funeral at the Smethwick temple, which has pro-Khalistan flags flying outside, was attended by thousands. - Shockwaves - The announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September that there were credible allegations linking India to the killing of another pro-Khalistan activist in Toronto on June 18 sent shockwaves through the Sikh diaspora. Story continues India strenuously denies any links, but the announcement prompted Khanda's family and friends to demand a coroner's inquest into his death. I don't know what investigation they did, but it would have only taken a few hours, Amit Singh, a volunteer at Smethwick-based Punjab broadcaster PBC, told AFP. The community feels that they definitely didn't take anything seriously. Until an investigation occurs, doubt will remain, added Singh, who was with Khanda shortly before he was taken to hospital. The High Commission of India in London did not reply to an AFP request for comment on the case. According to Jas Singh, more broadly there was now a high level of apprehension and fear among Britain's Sikhs, especially those who travel back to India. There is extra security at the gurdwara. It's disappointing that the police and the authorities have not reached out to the community, he added. He believes the UK government's desire to secure a trade deal with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government has led them to ignore the community's concerns. Not only do we have their silence, but we also have them going the other way with (UK Prime Minister) Rishi Sunak announcing pro-Khalistan extremism as an issue. Sikhs have no arrests, no pending cases, no threat or risk to British interests, he added. jwp/phz/fg/smw ",negative,,EN,,,"0,74",KENYA,30818,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/edf181102c2cf52953cd01e1450e2ce5,316829574,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,95048872,0,0,P00,,,P

ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement The new coin is the first of seven designs celebrating the James Bond legacy (Royal Mint/PA) The first coin celebrating 007 in the 1960s depicts Sean Connery's Bond seated in Little Nellie, the gyroplane from the film You Only Live Twice. It is the first of seven coin designs celebrating the legacy of Bond, with the other designs being unveiled individually at later dates. The titles of each Bond film of the decade make up the background, the stylised 007 logo of the 1960s appears at the base of the coin, and the classic gun barrel features around the perimeter of the design. Rebecca Morgan, director of commemorative coin at the Royal Mint, said: James Bond is Britain's favourite secret agent who has captivated audiences for over 60 years. We are delighted to be unveiling a new collectable coin range to celebrate 007's journey. Each coin will feature a unique design linking to the films of that decade, which is a testament to the coin making skills that our craftspeople have perfected over the years. We hope 007 enthusiasts and coin collectors find a special place for these limited-edition coins in their existing James Bond or coin collections. Andrew Dickey, director of precious metals at the Royal Mint, said: We're excited to launch the 007 range of bullion coins, a celebration of British culture that combines exclusive design with meticulous craftsmanship. These bullion coins, available in 1oz gold and 1oz silver and minted to the highest specifications, embody the standards of quality and excellence expected from a world-leading mint. I have no doubt they'll resonate with investors and collectors, as well as a new audience seeking to give the timeless gift of gold or silver. Coins are available as gold proof, silver proof and brilliant uncirculated editions, with prices starting from Â£14.50. Prices for James Bond fine gold and fine silver bullion coins will be based on live precious metal prices.

Huge thanks to Profoto who provided A2 units for our photo teams to use. We made pictures of dancers, and also fashion models on the beachfront of the Pacific Coast at Alma del Pacifico Beach Hotel & Spa and in the Cloud Forest at El Silencio Lodge & Spa, working with the incredibly reliable and easy to use Profoto system.

He highlights the World Diabetes Day: Addressing the Multifaceted Challenges of Blood Sugar Cong will free MP from corruption & unemployment, Says Kamal Nath Ashutosh Shukla & Prasenjit Mund / TNN / Updated: Nov 15, 2023, 08:58 IST Former Chief Minister and PCC chief Kamal Nath discusses his vision for a transformed Madhya Pradesh in the upcoming 2023 elections. He highlights the differences between the 2018 and 2023 models, emphasizing the Congress party's strengthened organization and the use of social media to communicate achievements and expose the failures of the BJP government. Nath also outlines his priorities if Congress wins, including implementing welfare schemes, conducting a caste-based census, and addressing corruption and unemployment. He promises to fill government vacancies, provide support for contract and daily wage employees, and attract private sector investment for job creation. Nath refutes accusations from CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan regarding discontinuation of welfare schemes and asserts that the state's debt is a result of corruption and mismanagement by the BJP government. He assures that Congress will fulfill its promises and accuses the BJP of failing to deliver on their commitments. Nath emphasizes the importance of ending corruption, protecting women from atrocities, and addressing malnourishment in the state. He also discusses the need for industrial development, particularly in the IT sector, and emphasizes the importance of a favorable business environment and long-term planning. Nath urges the people of Madhya Pradesh to support the truth and cast their vote for the Congress party. He promises jobs for the youth, support for farmers, and a favorable environment for industrialists. Kamal Nath Leading a resurgent Congress into the 2023 poll battle, former CM and PCC chief Kamal Nath tells TOI about his vision for a 'transformed' Madhya Pradesh . You've often said the 'Kamal Nath model of 2023' is different from 2018. How so? I took charge of Madhya Pradesh Congress six months before the 2018 elections. The circumstances then were different. So was the situation of our organization and the aspirations of people. But in these five years, Congress has established a robust organization. Today, every Congress worker is tougher than a BJP worker. More people are on social media today than five years ago and we can tell the public what we did during 15 months of government and what Shivraj Singh Chouhan did during his 18 years. How the state has been ruined. Some things are for the future, let time come and everyone will know what is the 'Model of 2023'. When can we expect the promised caste census? nAfter the formation of Congress government, it is our priority to conduct caste-based census. What are your other priorities if Congress wins the election? We've made it clear that we will first implement Nari Samman Yojana to give Rs 1,500 in the account of sisters from January 1, 2024. Domestic gas cylinders will be given for Rs 500. Farmer loan waiver, free power up to 100 units and at half price till 200 units, restoration of old pension, 27% reservation for OBCs - these are top priorities. If there's one thing that MP needs urgently, what is it? n First of all, Madhya Pradesh wants freedom from corruption and unemployment. The Shivraj government has made MP synonymous with scams, corruption and commission. We have to change this identity. What is your roadmap to solving unemployment? n There are more than 40 lakh registered unemployed in MP, while the actual number is more than 1 crore. We have announced to fill 2 lakh government vacancies and backlog posts. Fees for competitive examinations will be waived. We have also promised better living and social security for contract and daily wage employees. We will create employment opportunities by encouraging additional private sector investment. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan often accuses you of discontinuing all his welfare schemes during your stint as chief minister. What do you have to say? n Shivraj Singh Chouhan has made 25,000 false announcements in his 18-year tenure, and 2,500 in last three and a half years. What can I say about Shivraj ji, whose name in MP is 'ghoshna machine' (announcement machine). Their lies can be understood from the fact that till two days ago BJP hoardings were put up all over MP advertising that Rs 3000 per month will be given to Ladli Behnas but when BJP's manifesto came, this was not even mentioned. Shivraj says one thing, manifesto says another. Such governments stop â€˜schemes' on their own; it doesn't take someone else to do it. The Congress â€˜guarantees' will come at a massive price. How will you get the funds when the state is already under debt? When we announced farmer loan waiver in the last assembly elections, people questioned us, but we did it. We disbursed the first installment of loan, worth Rs 11,500 crore, to 27 lakh farmers. We made our commitments only after thoroughly examining the financial aspects. We can account for every paisa. Madhya Pradesh is in debt because the Shivraj government took loans and used government money to distribute among BJP workers, for commission in contracts and for corruption, not for development or welfare schemes. But all this is about to change. BJP ran a campaign in the post-2018 scenario and in 2023 that Congress didn't fulfil its farm loan waiver promise The character of BJP is to lie. The Madhya Pradesh government itself said in the assembly that the Congress government had waived loans of 27 lakh farmers. If someone tells a white lie, what can be said? Also remember that in 2008, BJP had announced farmer loan waiver but never fulfilled it. The farmer loan waiver we gave was stopped as soon as the BJP government was formed. We are going to form the government again, and we'll waive the loans of farmers. The farmer of MP knows these things very well. No one can fool him. You go to villages and ask farmers if they know that 5hp electricity for irrigation is going to be waived and up to 10 hp will cost half price. Who does not know that Congress has proposed to purchase wheat at Rs 2600 per quintal and paddy at Rs 2500 per quintal? If Congress makes a promise, it will fulfil. BJP promised to double the income of farmers by 2022, but it's end-2023 and the promise isn't fulfilled. BJP's pot of lies is overflowing. Will you continue with the socalled bulldozer justice? Now the public is going to bulldoze BJP. Will youngsters in Congress get more responsibility? Is there a second rung of leadership? Congress always runs a balance between experience and youth. When I came into politics of Madhya Pradesh I was very young. Even today, when I go among the public, seeing the enthusiasm of the youth, I feel Congress has a bright future. There is no dearth of young leaders in Congress and when the time comes, all will serve the party and the state. How will you stop farm suicides and ensure MP doesn't top in rape cases? MP is No. 1 in atrocities against women not because there are too many criminals here but because criminals get the protection of BJP leaders. The man who buried alive a tribal girl and her entire family in Nemawar was associated with BJP. In Datia, a BJP leader's name was revealed in torture of two innocent girls. Agirl was shot in Jabalpur by a BJP leader. If criminals do not get protection from people in power then crime will automatically come down. The Congress, however, sees a criminal only as a criminal and will punish him as such. It's BJP that opened fire on farmers in Mandsaur. BJP stopped the bonus on wheat. Earlier, fertilizer and seeds were given through cooperative societies but BJP gave it away ",neutral,,EN,,,"0,93",AUSTRALIA,28583,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105222552,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1397489,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",205591556,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,61677466,0,0,N00,,,P

Play/Pause Button Pause There's a very general subgoal that helps with almost all goals: get more control, Hinton said of A.I.s. The research question is: how do you prevent them from ever wanting to take control? And nobody knows the answer.Illustration by Daniel LiÃ©vano Save this story Save this story Save this story In your brain, neurons are arranged in networks big and small. With every action, with every thought, the networks change: neurons are included or excluded, and the connections between them strengthen or fade. This process goes on all the timeâ€”it's happening now, as you read these wordsâ€”and its scale is beyond imagining. You have some eighty billion neurons sharing a hundred trillion connections or more. Your skull contains a galaxy's worth of constellations, always shifting. Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist who is often called the godfather of A.I., handed me a walking stick. You'll need one of these, he said. Then he headed off along a path through the woods to the shore. It wound across a shaded clearing, past a pair of sheds, and then descended by stone steps to a small dock. It's slippery here, Hinton warned, as we started down. New knowledge incorporates itself into your existing networks in the form of subtle adjustments. Sometimes they're temporary: if you meet a stranger at a party, his name might impress itself only briefly upon the networks in your memory. But they can also last a lifetime, if, say, that stranger becomes your spouse. Because new knowledge merges with old, what you know shapes what you learn. If someone at the party tells you about his trip to Amsterdam, the next day, at a museum, your networks may nudge you a little closer to the Vermeer . In this way, small changes create the possibility for profound transformations. We had a bonfire here, Hinton said. We were on a ledge of rock jutting out into Ontario's Georgian Bay, which stretches to the west into Lake Huron. Islands dotted the water; Hinton had bought this one in 2013, when he was sixty-five, after selling a three-person startup to Google for forty-four million dollars. Before that, he'd spent three decades as a computer-science professor at the University of Torontoâ€”a leading figure in an unglamorous subfield known as neural networks, which was inspired by the way neurons are connected in the brain. Because artificial neural networks were only moderately successful at the tasks they undertookâ€”image categorization, speech recognition, and so onâ€”most researchers considered them to be at best mildly interesting, or at worst a waste of time. Our neural nets just couldn't do anything better than a child could, Hinton recalled. In the nineteen-eighties, when he saw The Terminator, it didn't bother him that Skynet, the movie's world-destroying A.I., was a neural net; he was pleased to see the technology portrayed as promising. From the small depression where the fire had been, cracks in the stone, created by the heat, radiated outward. Hinton, who is tall, slim, and English, poked the spot with his stick. A scientist through and through, he is always remarking on what is happening in the physical world: the lives of animals, the flow of currents in the bay, the geology of the island. I put a mesh of rebar under the wood, so the air could get in, and it got hot enough that the metal actually went all soft, he said, in a wondering tone. That's a real fireâ€”something to be proud of! For decades, Hinton tinkered, building bigger neural nets structured in ingenious ways. He imagined new methods for training them and helping them improve. He recruited graduate students, convincing them that neural nets weren't a lost cause. He thought of himself as participating in a project that might come to fruition a century in the future, after he died. Meanwhile, he found himself widowed and raising two young children alone. During one particularly difficult period, when the demands of family life and research overwhelmed him, he thought that he'd contributed all he could. I was dead in the water at forty-six, he said. He didn't anticipate the speed with which, about a decade ago, neural-net technology would suddenly improve. Computers got faster, and neural nets, drawing on data available on the Internet, started transcribing speech, playing games, translating languages, even driving cars. Around the time Hinton's company was acquired, an A.I. boom began, leading to the creation of systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, which many believe are starting to change the world in unpredictable ways. Hinton set off along the shore, and I followed, the fractured rock shifting beneath me. Now watch this, he said. He stood before a lumpy, person-size boulder, which blocked our way. Here's how you get across. You throw your stickâ€”he tossed his to the other side of the boulderâ€”and then there are footholds here and here, and a handhold here. I watched as he scrambled over with easy familiarity, and then, more tentatively, I took the same steps myself. Whenever we learn, our networks of neurons changeâ€”but how, exactly? Researchers like Hinton, working with computers, sought to discover learning algorithms for neural nets, procedures through which the statistical weights of the connections among artificial neurons could change to assimilate new knowledge. In 1949, a psychologist named Donald Hebb proposed a simple rule for how people learn, often summarized as Neurons that fire together wire together. Once a group of neurons in your brain activates in synchrony, it's more likely to do so again; this helps explain why doing something is easier the second time. But it quickly became apparent that computerized neural networks needed another approach in order to solve complicated problems. As a young researcher, in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, Hinton drew networks of neurons in notebooks and imagined new knowledge arriving at their borders. How would a network of a few hundred artificial neurons store a concept? How would it revise that concept if it turned out to be flawed? We made our way around the shore to Hinton's cottage, the only one on the island. Glass-enclosed, it stood on stilts atop a staircase of broad, dark rocks. One time, we came out here and a huge water snake stuck his head up, Hinton said, as we neared the house. It was a fond memory. His father, a celebrated entomologist who'd named a little-known stage of metamorphosis, had instilled in him an affection for cold-blooded creatures. When he was a child, he and his dad kept a pit full of vipers, turtles, frogs, toads, and lizards in the garage. Today, when Hinton is on the islandâ€”he is often there in the warmer monthsâ€”he sometimes finds snakes and brings them into the house, so that he can watch them in a terrarium. He is a good observer of nonhuman minds, having spent a lifetime thinking about thinking from the bottom up. Earlier this year, Hinton left Google, where he'd worked since the acquisition. He was worried about the potential of A.I. to do harm, and began giving interviews in which he talked about the existential threat that the technology might pose to the human species. The more he used ChatGPT, an A.I. system trained on a vast corpus of human wri",positive,,EN,,,"2,15",UNITED STATES,8822,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654d7f0cd6789aaa932db285/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231120_r43378.jpg",12458042,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,3737412,0,0,P00,,,P

In contrast, Noida has collected about 60% of the fines. Environmentalists argue that poor enforcement renders fines ineffective. The UPPCB recommends the fine amount, but it is the responsibility of the administration to collect the penalty. Ghaziabad is still to recover Rs 261.2 lakh, while Noida has to collect Rs 409.6 lakh. The UPPCB often passes the responsibility of collecting fines to the district administrations. Fines act as deterrents, especially to check winter pollution, but poor enforcement can render the whole exercise futile, said environmentalists NOIDA: The UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) imposed fines of Rs 359.6 lakh from 2020-2023 on units and individuals violating anti-pollution measures in Ghaziabad, but the administration, so far, has collected only 27% of the amount. The collection in Noida is higher - about 60%. Fines act as deterrents, especially to check winter pollution, but poor enforcement can render the whole exercise futile, said environmentalists. Track the pollution level in your city According to rules, UPPCB recommends the fine amount but the penalty is collected by the administration. From 2020 to 2023, the Ghaziabad administration recovered Rs 98.4 lakh of the total Rs 359.6 lakh imposed on 170 violators, while the GB Nagar administration collected Rs 650 lakh of the total Rs 1,059.6 lakh imposed on 730 violators. Ghaziabad is still to recover Rs 261.2 lakh in fines, while its Noida counterpart has to collect Rs 409.6 lakh. The UPPCB often pats its back by recommending hefty fines on violators as a part of 'stringent' measures. The NGT, in an earlier order, directed the UPPCB to recommend fines on violators while entrusting the district administration with the responsibility of recovering the amount, which is then kept in a separate account and used for air pollution abatement measures at the discretion of the district magistrate. But when asked about the collected amount, the UPPCB passes the buck to the district administrations, said city-based environmentalist Sushil Raghav. Ghaziabad DM RK Singh said the additional DM (city) has the task of collecting fines. The collection has been reasonable. To collect 100% of fines imposed is practically impossible as it is difficult to trace the violators caught on the ground by the UPPCB. Vikas Mishra, the regional officer of UPPCB in Ghaziabad, said, The responsibility of checking violations like garbage burning, industrial pollution and others rests with the civic body. UPPCB can only recommend a fine. It is for the administration to realise the amount.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) Bitcoin wallets made before 2016 could be facing new attack risks due to a recently discovered software flaw, according to a new report from cryptocurrency startup Unciphered. Unciphered on Tuesday said the flaw, dubbed Randstorm, includes a collection of bugs, design choices and API (Application Programming Interface) changes that increased the vulnerability of Bitcoin wallets created between 2011 and 2015. That flaw may have impacted an estimated 1.4 million Bitcoin and if about 3 to 5 percent of wallets were impacted, the value of the coins at risk of being stolen is about $1.2 to $2.1 billion, according to the startup. The issue was discovered last year after the startup was working with a customer who was locked out of a Bitcoin wallet made on the site now known as Blockchain.com. While investigating how to recover the wallet, Unciphered discovered an issue in wallets made by BitcoinJS from 2011-2015. The startup said this flaw also was found in some Dogecoin wallets made in that same period on Dogecoin.info. Unciphered first shared their findings with the Washington Post , which reported BitcoinJS was supposed to make wallets with random cryptographic keys, but the flaw created keys that were not random enough. Unciphered pointed out that the discovery of the flaw does not mean Bitcoin or technology is not broken, but rather a series of programming mistakes that spread across several technologies between 2011-2015. Those who believe their wallet may be vulnerable were advised to move their assets to a new or more recently created wallet. Unciphere emphasized it's not the first organization to pick up on the vulnerability, pointing to a series of instances in the past eight years where individuals drew attention to problems with blockchain technology.

The Auckland Writers Festival's new artistic director on living in the book festival world, and what she's reading right now. Messenger Lyndsey Fineran's life in books (Image: Archi Banal) Welcome to The Spinoff Books Confessional , in which we get to know the reading habits and quirks of New Zealanders at large. This week: Lyndsey Fineran, artistic director of Auckland Writers Festival . The book I wish I'd written Piranesi by Susanna Clarke. The strange, labyrinthine world she builds â€“ at once otherworldly, and also very real â€“ is something else. It was the last thing I read in the bizarre year of 2020, when I was feeling completely spent and not up for using my brain for anything beyond Netflix. It completely fired me back up and made me fall back in love with fiction, creativityâ€¦ everything. I wish I had as big a brain as Susanna Clarke clearly does, but I'll very happily settle for wandering the strange halls she creates. Everyone should read Whatever they want! The idea of people feeling guilty about their TBR piles, or bad about not having read X or Y yet makes me feel cross. Life has so many demands, structures and shoulds; reading is a space to delightfully ignore all that. Rebellious curiosity for the win. Favourite encounter with an author Festival life throws up many of these! Seeing Martin Amis and Richard Ford leave joke gifts for each other with the hotel concierge in what appeared to be a long-running bit between them. Watching Hilary Mantel walk into the Green Room and exclaim My two Henrys are here! upon seeing Damian Lewis and Nathaniel Parker in the same room. Seeing Mary Beard Wikipedia-ing the plot to Medea moments before going into an on-stage debate about it (if Mary Beard has to do it, it should make us all feel better). Hearing Toni Morrison speak live on the day Maya Angelou passed and offering the most beautiful tribute. Spending an afternoon with the late travel writer Jan Morris in her home in Wales packed with a life-worth of books and travel mementoes. I could be here for a whileâ€¦ The book I want to be buried with To be honest, I'm more likely to be buried by books, which anyone who has witnessed how I organise my desk or hard surfaces in my home can attest to â€¦ but when I think seriously of books I'd like to be with at the end, it would probably be a big anthology of travel and memoir writing by brave and creative minds I admire. I know that's somewhat of a cop-out of an answer but what I particularly loved about that afternoon with Jan Morris was seeing her content at home after a life rich with experiences, travels and words. I think returning to a nest and being happy in an armchair reading of others' adventures while happily tired and content from your own would be a nice way to wrap things up. From left to right: The book Lyndsey Fineran wishes she'd written; the book that made her laugh; and the book that made her cry. The book that made me laugh Percival Everett's The Trees. At once a completely unflinching look at some of humanity's darkest parts, and one of the funniest books I read in years. The New York Times review summed it up well when it said you: cover a laughing mouth with one hand and stifle a gasp with the other. I remember that very physical, visceral reading experience and the constant push / pull between two very different states and reactions. It all adds to the squirm Everett knows he's putting his reader through. It's such a skill. The book that I pretend to have read Pride and Prejudice, because people get mad when I mention I have never made it through it. I know there is more at play in it, I just can't make myself care about books where one of the main plot drivers is whether people will get married. Don't come at me. The book that haunts me I love dark reads. Samanta Schweblin's Fever Dream, Mariana Enriquez's Things We Lost in the Fire, Markus Z Danielewski's House of Leaves, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, most things by Cormac McCarthy, some Stephen King all are favourites. But one line that particularly spooked me is actually from To Kill a Mockingbird, when the kids stumble in Boo Radley's yard and you get the line Someone in the house was laughingâ€¦ It's not a scary read, but that one line genuinely still gives me a shiver whenever I think about it. Best food memory from a book I love reading about food in books â€“ various moments in Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveller's Wife have stuck in my brain, and Bryan Washington and Caleb Azumah Nelson are both so brilliant at capturing food in fiction. But I think childhood reads have the edge here in terms of strength of memory. The BFG with its snozzcumbers and frobscottle springs to mind, and I don't know many people, regardless of their age, who wouldn't turn down a go at a Harry Potter Great Hall feast. From left to right: the book Lyndsey Fineran pretends to have read; one of the books that haunts her; one of the books with a strong food memory. The book that made me cry I'm not a big crier at books, but I felt very emotionally invested in Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead. The extreme ups and downs of Demon's story, of course, but also Kingsolver's controlled fury about the ravages of the opioid crisis on her Appalachian community, and the truly evil behaviour of Big Pharma in the name of profits. Demon's story could have felt exploitative in the hands of someone else but Kingsolver's deep knowledge and empathy with her community, paired with her sadness and fury at the utter waste of life at the hands of these big corporations is all there in among the affecting twists of turns of the bildungsroman. The best thing about reading So many: being able to indulge your curiosity, getting to live endless lives in one, getting moments of stillness in a busy life. And as a woman, getting to do something solo and that's completely for you â€“ that still feels somewhat radical to me. But the thing I always come back to is discovery. You genuinely never know where that next read might take you, what thought or memory it might trigger, new perspective it prompts you to consider, what it might lead you to read or talk to someone about next, or where it might physically take you. I'm quite the extreme example of that (books brought me literally to the other side of the world), but regardless of the scale, giving yourself over to the journey / the ride of it all holds real magic. (Please know how much it pained me to write â€˜journey' there, but it is one). It also why I love the book festival world so much: you can see much of these discoveries, these ripples happening in real time. That's magical. The best place to read I moved into my own place for the first time in my late 20s after many years of group and joint living, and getting uninterrupted hours in a big armchair or reading in the bath until the water ran cold was total bliss. Regardless of life's next chapters, I'll always hold that period of fierce independence and happy solitude very fondly in my mind. I spent a weekend on Great Barrier Island recently, and got to read in a hammock under the stars. That was pretty great too. What are you reading right now? So many great things. Bird Life by Anna Smaill, The Bone Tree by Airana Ngarewa, Better the Blood by Michael Bennett, an excellent memoir Do You Still Have Time for Chaos by Lynn Davidson, Tusiata Avia's new poetry collection Big Fat Brown Bitch and Lauren Groff's The Vaster Wilds. And like many women of my generation, I'm listening to the audiobook of Britney Spears' memoir The Woman in Me.

I look skeptically on the collective definitions of education problems: are we seeing issues correctly? In my research, I have focused on how we defined dropping out of high school as a problem, how we think of public-private distinctions in education, how school accountability evolved, and how we have defined schools as communities. I believe that as individuals, we have holes in our mental model of social problems, and as a society, those holes are reflected in what we think are educational problems and how we try to solve them. We need to identify those mental holes so we are not limited by them. My current major project is the history of educational broadcasting in the U.S. since 1945.

This means you don't own the data your car generates. Today's cars include hundreds of computer chips, and carmakers say the data produced by those chips is proprietary â€“ and a security risk. This means you don't own the data your car generates. Cars are no longer just a means of transportation. They have become rolling hubs of data communication. Modern vehicles regularly transmit information wirelessly to their manufacturers . However, as cars grow smarter, the right to repair them is under siege . As legal scholars , we find that the question of whether you and your local mechanic can tap into your car's data to diagnose and repair spans issues of property rights, trade secrets, cybersecurity, data privacy and consumer rights. Policymakers are forced to navigate this complex legal landscape and ideally are aiming for a balanced approach that upholds the right to repair, while also ensuring the safety and privacy of consumers. Understanding telematics and right to repair Until recently, repairing a car involved connecting to its standard on-board diagnostics port to retrieve diagnostic data. The ability for independent repair shops â€“ not just those authorized by the manufacturer â€“ to access this information was protected by a state law in Massachusetts , approved by voters on Nov. 6, 2012, and by a nationwide memorandum of understanding between major car manufacturers and the repair industry signed on Jan. 15, 2014. However, with the rise of telematics systems, which combine computing with telecommunications, these dynamics are shifting. Unlike the standardized onboard diagnostics ports, telematics systems vary across car manufacturers. These systems are often protected by digital locks , and circumventing these locks could be considered a violation of copyright law. The telematics systems also encrypt the diagnostic data before transmitting it to the manufacturer. This reduces the accessibility of telematics information, potentially locking out independent repair shops and jeopardizing consumer choice â€“ a lack of choice that can lead to increased costs for consumers . Also, these telematics systems fall outside the scope of the original Massachusetts legislation and the nationwide memorandum of understanding. Recognizing the pivotal role diagnostic data plays in vehicle maintenance and repair, 75% of Massachusetts voters approved a ballot initiative on Nov. 3, 2020, to amend the state's repair legislation . The amendment aims to ensure that the switch to telematics does not curtail an effective right to repair vehicles. Specifically, the new law requires manufacturers selling telematics-equipped vehicles from the 2022 model year onward to provide car owners and their chosen repair shops access to the vehicle's mechanical data through an interoperable, standardized and open-access telematics platform . Access should also encompass the ability to relay commands to components of the vehicle, if necessary, for maintenance, diagnostics and repair. Voters in Maine overwhelmingly approved a similar measure on Nov. 7, 2023. However, the Massachusetts law was the subject of a lawsuit in federal court shortly after voters approved it in 2020, and it was suspended until June 1, 2023. Repairing cars today is as much about data as it is nuts and bolts, but increasingly, carmakers are locking that data away from car owners and independent repair shops. Nenad Stojkovic/Flickr , CC BY Safety and privacy concerns While the amendment makes significant strides toward creating a level playing field in vehicle maintenance and repair, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and car manufacturers have raised concerns about the legislation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's main concern revolves around cybersecurity vulnerabilities with potential ramifications for vehicle safety, particularly the amendment's provision for two-way access. A hacker could potentially take control of a car's critical systems like accelerator, brakes and steering. Consequently, the agency recommended that car manufacturers not adhere to the law . A related argument is that Massachusetts law is preempted by federal law. This forms the basis of a lawsuit filed in November 2020 by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation against Massachusetts' attorney general. The manufacturers assert that abiding by the state law would inevitably put them in breach of federal statutes and regulations, such as the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act . This lawsuit was pending as of press time, although the Massachusetts attorney general declared the law effective as of June 1, 2023. Critics also emphasize the privacy concerns associated with open access to telematics systems. Granting third-party access could expose personal details , especially real-time location data. Advocacy groups warn that this information might be used as a tracking tool by potential abusers and others aiming to exploit people. Recent developments The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Massachusetts' attorney general appear to have reached a consensus on alterations to the law, and the administration has dropped its recommendation that manufacturers disregard the law. The primary adjustment would mean a telematics platform would be in compliance with the right to repair law if it were accessible within close proximity to the vehicle â€“ for example, via Bluetooth. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirmed that this would be safer and align with federal law . However, repair advocates have criticized this change as unduly restrictive . They argue that it gives authorized car dealers an unfair advantage over independent repair shops because the manufacturers allow the dealers to access the data remotely. A new federal bill, the REPAIR Act , was recently introduced in the House, seeking to require vehicle manufacturers to provide access to in-vehicle diagnostic data, including telematics. This bill's first hearing occurred on Sept. 27, 2023, and the bill passed out of subcommittee on Nov. 2. Consumer Reports is among the organizations that support right-to-repair legislation. Who owns your car's data? One issue left unresolved by the legislation is the ownership of vehicle data . A vehicle generates all sorts of data as it operates, including location, diagnostic, driving behavior, and even usage patterns of in-car systems â€“ for example, which apps you use and for how long. In recent years, the question of data ownership has gained prominence. In 2015, Congress legislated that the data stored in event data recorders belongs to the vehicle owner. This was a significant step in acknowledging the vehicle owner's right over specific datasets. However, the broader issue of data ownership in today's connected cars remains unresolved. Whether data should be subject to property rights is a matter of debate. If deemed property, it seems logical to award these rights to the vehicle owner because the vehicle creates the data while used by the owner. However, through contractual terms and digital locks, manufacturers effectively secure control over the data. The question of ownership aside, the crux of the matter for right to repair is guaranteed access for vehicle owners to their vehicles' data. A way forward While concerns surrounding the Massachusetts legislation have merit, we believe they should not overshadow the need to preserve a competitive space in the auto repair sector and preserve the right to repair. This matters not only for safeguarding consumers' autonomy and ensuring competitive pricing, but also for minimizing environmental waste from prematurely discarded vehicles and parts. The hope is that policymakers and the industry can strike a balance: upholding the right to repair without compromising safety and privacy.

In a new study, they traced the chemicals' origins to help stop the harm. Scientists discovered PFAS hot spots in the bay and found PFAS in water along the Atlantic coast. In a new study, they traced the chemicals' origins to help stop the harm. Messenger PFAS, the forever chemicals that have been raising health concerns across the country, are not just a problem in drinking water. As these chemicals leach out of failing septic systems and landfills and wash off airport runways and farm fields , they can end up in streams that ultimately discharge into ocean ecosystems where fish, dolphins, manatees, sharks and other marine species live. We study the risks from these persistent pollutants in coastal environments as environmental analytical chemists at Florida International University's Institute of the Environment. Because PFAS can enter the food chain and accumulate in marine plants and animals, including fish that humans eat, the spread of these chemicals has ecological and human health implications. Biscayne Bay and nearby coastal areas are teeming with fish, including many varieties that people eat. NPS image by Shaun Wolfe In a new study, we traced the origins of PFAS contamination in Miami's Biscayne Bay to help pinpoint ways to reduce the harm. What are PFAS? PFAS â€“ perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances â€“ are a group of human-made contaminants that have been used for over 50 years . They're found in personal care products, such as cosmetics and shampoo, and in water-repellent coatings for nonstick cookware and food packaging. They're also used in adhesives and aqueous firefighting foams, among other products. As those PFAS-containing products washed down drains and were thrown in landfills over the years, PFAS chemicals became widespread in the environment. Eventually, these chemicals found their way into aquatic ecosystems, including surface water, groundwater and coastal environments. An illustration shows some of the sources of PFAS in the environment. North Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control The same stability and resistance to degrading that makes these chemicals valuable for water- and stain-proof products also makes them nearly impossible to destroy. Hence, the nickname forever chemicals. They persist in the environment for decades to centuries. That's a problem, because PFAS have been linked to immunological disorders , endocrine, developmental, reproductive and neurological disruption and increased risk of bladder, liver , kidney and testicular cancer . A drinking water study by the U.S. Geological Survey estimated these chemicals were in at least 45% of tap water across the U.S., and a large percentage of Americans are now believed to have PFAS detectable in their blood . Studies have also found PFAS in a broad range of marine wildlife , including in the livers of otters and in gulls' eggs, as well as in freshwater fish across the U.S. These chemicals have already been shown to affect the immune system and liver function of fish and marine mammals . How PFAS get into the marine environment When we began tracking the sources of PFAS in Biscayne Bay, we found hot spots of these chemicals around the exits of urban canals â€“ especially the Miami River, Little River and Biscayne Canal. Each of these canals, we found, is a major point source contributing to the presence of PFAS in offshore areas of the Atlantic Ocean. One major source of that PFAS is sewage contamination from failed septic systems and wastewater leaks in urban areas. This is evident by the presence of the types of PFAS â€“ such as PFOS, PFOA, PFPeA, PFHxS, PFHxA, PFBA and PFBS â€“ that are used as stain and grease repellents and in carpets, food packaging materials and household products. Another major source is represented by the predominance of 6-2 FTS in the Miami River â€“ 6-2 FTS is a fluorotelomer PFAS typically used in aqueous film-forming foam found at military and airport facilities. The Miami River flows past rail yards, industries and Miami International Airport on its way to Biscayne Bay. A map from the study shows PFAS hot spots near canals that carry water from the city. Red indicates higher PFAS concentrations, measured in nanograms per liter. Green indicates lower, more diluted PFAS concentrations. CC BY-ND We also used a model to predict how ocean currents would disperse PFAS coming out of those canals and into coastal areas. We found that the PFAS concentrations were highest close to the canals, decreased along the bay and declined as ocean water became deeper and more saline, which makes PFAS less soluble in water. Overall, PFAS concentrations were almost six times higher in surface waters near land compared with deep-water samples collected 13 to 33 feet (4 to 10 meters) below the surface in the bay and offshore. That suggests the highest risk is to pelagic fish that hang out in surface waters, such as mackerel, tunas and mahi-mahi. How marine organisms are at risk The levels of PFOS and PFOA in our study were below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection advisory levels in surface water for human health exposure. However, the advisory levels might not be protective of human and marine life. They do not take into consideration that these chemicals accumulate through the food chain . Higher concentration in the top of the food web means PFAS could pose a greater risk to dolphins , sharks and humans that consume fish . Olutobi Daniel Ogunbiyi, an author of this article and lead author of the study, takes water samples in Biscayne Bay. CC BY-ND Many types of PFAS identified in our samples are not regulated, and their potential toxicity is unknown. We believe there is a need for federal and state agencies to develop guidelines and implement action plans to protect people and the aquatic life in Biscayne Bay. What you can do about it Given the persistence of PFAS and their widespread use, it is not surprising that these forever chemicals are found in almost all water systems in South Florida and are showing up in coastal waters around the world . While scientists look for effective and efficient ways to eliminate and remove these chemicals from water, food and the environment, people can limit their use of PFAS-containing products to reduce the amounts of these chemicals that get into the marine environment. Here are some common products that contain PFAS to watch for: Teflon nonstick cookware; food packaging for fast food and popcorn; water-resistant clothing and cosmetics; and treated carpets.

Savea, who was named World Rugby men's player of the year after the World Cup in France , has been nominated for the All Blacks Player of the Year award, and should also be a frontrunner for the prestigious Kelvin R Tremain Memorial Player of the Year award. No 8 Savea, who also captained the All Blacks four times this season when Sam Cane was unavailable, produced a series of eye-catching performances during the World Cup. He won't be available for the Hurricanes in Super Rugby Pacific next year as he is taking a sabbatical to play for the Kobelco Kobe Steelers club in Japan. Jordie Barrett, Scott Barrett and Aaron Smith are also in the running for the All Blacks Player of the Year award. Barrett is also one of three nominees in the Super Rugby Pacific Player of the Year category. He is joined by Damian McKenzie and Mark Tele'a. Departed All Blacks coach Ian Foster, who has been replaced by Scott Robertson through to the 2027 World Cup, will be eligible for the New Zealand Coach of the Year award. All coaches of national teams will be considered for that trophy. Robertson, who guided the Crusaders to the Super Rugby Pacific title, is short-listed for the National Men's Coach of the Year award along with Nigel Walsh (South Canterbury) and Neil Barnes (Taranaki).

Ogni anni. Questo il quantitativo di prodotti nuovi provenienti da Digitec Galaxus, Fust, Interdiscount e Competec in Svizzera che finiscono in discarica. La stima Ã¨ stata abbozzata da Greenpeace combinando i dati di un sondaggio tra i commercianti al dettaglio svizzeri e quelli del tracciamento sul destino delle merci acquistate e restituite in perfetto stato. Per ricavare tali dati, l'Ong a protezione dell'ambiente ha interpellato otto negozi (e quasi tutti hanno risposto alle domande in modo incompleto). Le societÃ  di fast fashion H&M, Inditex (che comprende per esempio Zara e Massimo Dutti) e Zalando, affermano di consegnare i prodotti invenduti ad organizzazioni, punti vendita e grossisti che li riutilizzano o talvolta li smaltiscono presso delle strutture adibite al riciclaggio. La storia non Ã¨ molto diversa con Digitec Galaxus, Interdiscount, Fust e Competec, che affermano di consegnare gli invenduti a delle organizzazioni che li riutilizzano, li rivendono come usato, li restituiscono ai fornitori o ancora li regalano ai dipendenti. Nell'affidare i propri invenduti a terzi, secondo Greenpeace, i commercianti si sottraggono alle proprie responsabilitÃ . La maggior parte delle suddette societÃ , infatti, non chiede dettagli sull'uso della merce ceduta. Apple, il gigante dell'elettronica, non ha invece risposto alle domande. Ma a risaltare, per mancanza di trasparenza, Ã¨ Digitec Galaxus. Nel 2022 l'affiliata della Migros ha realizzato un fatturato di 2,4 miliardi di franchi e da anni registra una forte crescita. Sebbene sia chiara nella pubblicitÃ  e nelle norme di garanzia e restituzione, la societÃ  si Ã¨ rifiutata di comunicare il numero degli articoli invenduti, la loro massa in chilogrammi e altre informazioni utili. Non solo, per quasi la metÃ  dei 6,3 milioni di prodotti venduti, il rivenditore non ha alcun controllo sulla consegna e sui resi perchÃ© questi provengono da rivenditori indipendenti. Al fine quindi di stabilire cosa accade agli invenduti di Digitec Galaxus, Greenpeace ha ordinato dal sito 25 prodotti sui quali, una volta arrivati, sono stati attaccati dei dispositivi di tracciamento. Quindi sono stati restituiti. Sei prodotti (una radio, una tastiera con mouse per computer, due diversi tostapane e due telecamere di rete) sono finiti in un centro di riciclaggio, dove sono stati poi distrutti. Non distruggeteli A fronte della sua analisi, Greenpeace chiede quindi ai rivenditori svizzeri di applicare alcune nuove misure al trattamento di resi e invenduti. Non distruggere piÃ¹ gli invenduti ancora utilizzabili, nÃ© direttamente nÃ© indirettamente Preferire il riutilizzo, la riparazione e la manutenzione, al riciclaggio Fornire informazioni trasparenti su come vengono gestiti i resi e l'inventario invenduto Garantire che i partner commerciali seguano gli stessi principi ",negative,,IT,,,"2,14",SWITZERLAND,7064,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://media.tio.ch/files/domains/tio.ch/images/4c3r/f_-ogni-anno-300-tonnellate-di-merce-invenduta-finiscono-in-discarica-1d92a.jpg?v=1,12631578,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,3789473,0,0,T00,,,P

Little is better than the warm feeling inside of revisiting this cast of characters I've come to know so fondly and intimately in a new, but familiar style.

Although the game doesn't exactly move the Persona series forward in a substantial way, Persona 5 Tactica brings an intriguing twist to the gameplay systems that fans come to know and love in a well-rounded RPG that respects the player's time. ------------- **[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant)** - [Shane Robert Moyer](https://opencritic.com/critic/9443/shane-robert-moyer) - [4 / 5 ](https://gamerant.com/persona-5-tactica-review/) >Atlus' Persona 5 Tactica drops the Phantom Thieves in a Medieval Europe-style world as they are dragged into an ongoing revolution by a mysterious figure. Rather than a traditional turn-based JRPG, the Persona 5 spin-off falls within the tactics genre. ------------- **[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Matheus Senna de Oliveira](https://opencritic.com/critic/7686/matheus-senna-de-oliveira) - *Portuguese* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2023/11/analise-persona-5-tactica-review.html) >The new adventures of Joker and company in Persona 5 Tactica manage to mix turn-based RPG with strategy in a very competent way. Exuding style and an engaging story, especially thanks to its charismatic characters, each new mission and its developments are unmissable. In particular, I liked the great freedom in solving missions and their challenges.

Its key issue lies in a fatal lack of mechanical balance, resulting in an endearing but unsatisfying strategy experience. ------------- **[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Rollin Bishop](https://opencritic.com/critic/655/rollin-bishop) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/persona-5-tactica-review/) >Persona 5 Tactica makes the most of combining Persona and tactics (as the name implies) together, forming a charming amalgamation out of the two for a surprisingly dense mechanical experience and powerful story that nevertheless loses something by omitting anything resembling side activities. ------------- **[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [Dalton McClain](https://opencritic.com/critic/7352/dalton-mcclain) - [90 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/persona-5-tactica-review-its-time-to-repaint-your-h",negative,,EN,,,1,UNKNOWN,5366,135,0,0,0,135,0,N,,,3250991,r/Games,Turbostrider27,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,975297,0,0,N00,,,P

(EDDY.V) (EDDYF) is a stock that I have known for a while. When having a look at the management team, you'll see several familiar names if you are a Manganese X Energy Corp. (MNXXF) (MN.V) shareholder like I am. Both stocks have been pounded into the dirt - unfairly in my opinion - along with many other juniors across the mining and other industries in this horrible multi-year bear market. EDDY recently closed a private placement at $0.12. I would have been interested in participating but unfortunately in order to buy something, I have to sell something else at equally disgustingly low prices. I wouldn't have been able to do that in an amount that would have made the effort of going through a PP worthwhile. Unlike my MN position, my position in EDDY is small, so I wanted a way to accumulate a larger interest in the stock. Lucky for me, EDDY is in an interesting position where its business model is going to require some education of the market. I signed a deal to help with this process, where I get paid to write blogs about this stock and general industry developments. The most important part of this compensation that I insisted upon were stock options. I am bullish on EDDY and want to accumulate a position where I stand to benefit significantly when this stock goes up. Eventually the market is going to turn and the bullish supercycle talk on electric vehicles materials is going to be all the rage again. EDDY is in a unique position to benefit from that. The management team has made the smart decision to educate the market and provide content while the market is in the dumps. When the market eventually turns around and people are more receptive to the story, there will be lots of content available. Rather than reactively trying to promote the stock. People say that compensated blogs will be biased. Well, anyone who writes an article, blog or comment about a stock they own will be biased, regardless of whether they were compensated or not. And if they DON'T own any position, there will be people who complain that they are talking up a stock without putting any money where their mouth is. It's an unwinnable situation to try to please everyone. Anyone can look at my past writeups and know that I try to capture as many of caveats, risks and potential downsides as I can along with talking about the upside potential. With EDDY, based on its position and market cap, I don't see a lot of downside left. Outside of the normal risks you see with all explorers (the price of metals, government permits, environmental issues, ability to raise serious capital for not just drilling but building a mine, etc.), there's not a lot to say. Other than defeated shareholders potentially selling on any spike to lessen their current paper loss or the $0.12 financing holders potentially selling for profits or to exercise warrants at $0.20 once the hold is up in four months. Management could conceivably end up sitting on their hands and using up the cash resources until the next round of dilution, but that's a long way from happening. The recent raise adds over $400,000 to company coffers. The balance sheet as of June 30th shows $1 million in a GIC and another nearly $700,000 in cash with essentially no liabilities. So the company has around $2 million in cash that should last a while, depending on how aggressively it plans to drill or purchase other properties. Prior to the financing, there was approximately 14.5 million shares and 4 million warrants which have a strike of over $1.00. After the financing closed, there is now a total of 18.5 million shares and 8 million warrants. At $0.20, people are paying a $4 million valuation for $2 million in cash and three valuable components. Those three components are: A cobalt property in Ontario. Multiple lithium properties in Argentina. A prospective sodium chloride play. The company is planning to spin out the cobalt property in Ontario into a separate company, similar to what Manganese X did with Graphano Energy Ltd. (GEL.V). Despite both MN and GEL tanking like a rock since then, I believe that this was mainly due to market forces. The spinout was a good move and I'd like to see it again with EDDY. I recently wrote an article on Seeking Alpha about the deal between Stellantis and Argentina Lithium & Energy Corp. (LIT.V). I'm very bullish on lithium projects in the area as the valuation that Stellantis threw at this company clearly shows a major disconnect between market pricing of lithium stocks in the area and what actual decision makers like a multi-billion dollar car manufacturer are willing to pay. On EDDY's website, the company boasts a metric that shows it is trading at a level that is far below what its property size implies when comparing to peers. But my bullishness on the company isn't based on the cobalt spinout nor the lithium properties. It's primarily on the smart moves the company is making in securing sodium chloride assets and its willingness to be a thought leader in the electric vehicle industry with respect to the sodium-ion battery. The company recently created the website sodiumbatteryhub.com. This website is an AI-assisted aggregation of commentary around the upside, necessity and utility of a Na-ion battery for the EV industry. My mile high level analysis of the EV industry to this point was that the focus up until now was mainly on range. How far could an EV go before it needed a charge, because they were far behind ICE vehicles in this aspect. Now we are beginning to see an increase concern around cost. Cost of the EV themselves, cost to replace a battery and cost of recycling the thing once it has reached end-of-life. As sodium chloride is more plentiful and cheaper than lithium, a battery based on this chemistry is being explored. Range will be sacrificed, but that's not a problem to me. In my opinion, the entire EV industry and forced conversion from ICE is a government-mandated fantasy sham. We don't have nearly the amount of lithium to make it happen. We don't have the amount of copper nor graphite nor \*insert critical metal here\* to make it happen. We don't have the capacity on power grids to make it happen. In order for the mass adoption of EVs to be possible, it'll have to be all hands on deck for a myriad of entrepreneurs thinking up of creative solutions to the problem. EDDY is just one company. It can't solve all the issues, but it can contribute to solving one of the issues. While I'll be part of the education process on the benefits of an Na-ion battery compared to Li-on, it honestly doesn't matter to me. We need BOTH, desperately. If Na-ion batteries have limited range that means cheaper and smaller vehicles appropriate for urban driving, well, there is a lot of that type of driving taking place today. Stop and go city traffic driving is least efficient and therefore most pollutive source of driving. Most small cap exploration companies are reactive. You see that often enough when XYZ Gold changes its name to XYZ Lithium in order to participate in a hyped sector. EDDY itself has been guilty of that in the past. But what EDDY is doing differently this time around is that it's getting ahead of the curve and trying to be a thought leader, instead of a reactive bandwagon jumper. It's out there trying to educate people about the Na-ion battery and stake properties before it becomes the trendy and expensive thing to do. I've never seen a small cap explorer operate like this. I'm morally aligned to this way of doing business, and that's ultimately why I am choosing to be long this stock.",positive,,EN,,,"4,5",UNKNOWN,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,,2101,r/PennyStockWatch,Professional_Disk131,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,630,0,0,P00,,,P

At $0.20, people are paying a $4 million valuation for $2 million in cash and three valuable components. Those three components are: 1. A cobalt property in Ontario. 2. Multiple lithium properties in Argentina. 3. A prospective sodium chloride play. The company is planning to spin out the cobalt property in Ontario into a separate company, similar to what Manganese X did with Graphano Energy Ltd. (GEL.V). Despite both MN and GEL tanking like a rock since then, I believe that this was mainly due to market forces. The spinout was a good move and I'd like to see it again with EDDY. I recently wrote an article on Seeking Alpha about the deal between Stellantis and Argentina Lithium & Energy Corp. (LIT.V). I'm very bullish on lithium projects in the area as the valuation that Stellantis threw at this company clearly shows a major disconnect between market pricing of lithium stocks in the area and what actual decision makers like a multi-billion dollar car manufacturer are willing to pay. On EDDY's website, the company boasts a metric that shows it is trading at a level that is far below what its property size implies when comparing to peers. But my bullishness on the company isn't based on the cobalt spinout nor the lithium properties. It's primarily on the smart moves the company is making in securing sodium chloride assets and its willingness to be a thought leader in the electric vehicle industry with respect to the sodium-ion battery. The company recently created the website [sodiumbatteryhub.com](http://sodiumbatteryhub.com/). This website is an AI-assisted aggregation of commentary around the upside, necessity and utility of a Na-ion battery for the EV industry. My mile high level analysis of the EV industry to this point was that the focus up until now was mainly on range. How far could an EV go before it needed a charge, because they were far behind ICE vehicles in this aspect. Now we are beginning to see an increase concern around cost. Cost of the EV themselves, cost to replace a battery and cost of recycling the thing once it has reached end-of-life. As sodium chloride is more plentiful and cheaper than lithium, a battery based on this chemistry is being explored. Range will be sacrificed, but that's not a problem to me. In my opinion, the entire EV industry and forced conversion from ICE is a government-mandated fantasy sham. We don't have nearly the amount of lithium to make it happen. We don't have the amount of copper nor graphite nor \*insert critical metal here\* to make it happen. We don't have the capacity on power grids to make it happen. In order for the mass adoption of EVs to be possible, it'll have to be all hands on deck for a myriad of entrepreneurs thinking up of creative solutions to the problem. EDDY is just one company. It can't solve all the issues, but it can contribute to solving one of the issues. While I'll be part of the education process on the benefits of an Na-ion battery compared to Li-on, it honestly doesn't matter to me. We need BOTH, desperately. If Na-ion batteries have limited range that means cheaper and smaller vehicles appropriate for urban driving, well, there is a lot of that type of driving taking place today. Stop and go city traffic driving is least efficient and therefore most pollutive source of driving. Most small cap exploration companies are reactive. You see that often enough when XYZ Gold changes its name to XYZ Lithium in order to participate in a hyped sector. EDDY itself has been guilty of that in the past. But what EDDY is doing differently this time around is that it's getting ahead of the curve and trying to be a thought leader, instead of a reactive bandwagon jumper. It's out there trying to educate people about the Na-ion battery and stake properties before it becomes the trendy and expensive thing to do. I've never seen a small cap explorer operate like this.

(EDDY.V) (EDDYF)** is a stock that I have known for a while. When having a look at the management team, you'll see several familiar names if you are a Manganese X Energy Corp. (MNXXF) (MN.V) shareholder like I am. Both stocks have been pounded into the dirt - unfairly in my opinion - along with many other juniors across the mining and other industries in this horrible multi-year bear market. EDDY recently closed a private placement at $0.12. I would have been interested in participating but unfortunately in order to buy something, I have to sell something else at equally disgustingly low prices. I wouldn't have been able to do that in an amount that would have made the effort of going through a PP worthwhile. Unlike my MN position, my position in EDDY is small, so I wanted a way to accumulate a larger interest in the stock. Lucky for me, EDDY is in an interesting position where its business model is going to require some education of the market. I signed a deal to help with this process, where I get paid to write blogs about this stock and general industry developments. The most important part of this compensation that I insisted upon were stock options. I am bullish on EDDY and want to accumulate a position where I stand to benefit significantly when this stock goes up. Eventually the market is going to turn and the bullish supercycle talk on electric vehicles materials is going to be all the rage again. EDDY is in a unique position to benefit from that. The management team has made the smart decision to educate the market and provide content while the market is in the dumps. When the market eventually turns around and people are more receptive to the story, there will be lots of content available. Rather than reactively trying to promote the stock. People say that compensated blogs will be biased. Well, anyone who writes an article, blog or comment about a stock they own will be biased, regardless of whether they were compensated or not. And if they DON'T own any position, there will be people who complain that they are talking up a stock without putting any money where their mouth is. It's an unwinnable situation to try to please everyone. Anyone can look at my past writeups and know that I try to capture as many of caveats, risks and potential downsides as I can along with talking about the upside potential. With EDDY, based on its position and market cap, I don't see a lot of downside left. Outside of the normal risks you see with all explorers (the price of metals, government permits, environmental issues, ability to raise serious capital for not just drilling but building a mine, etc.), there's not a lot to say. Other than defeated shareholders potentially selling on any spike to lessen their current paper loss or the $0.12 financing holders potentially selling for profits or to exercise warrants at $0.20 once the hold is up in four months. Management could conceivably end up sitting on their hands and using up the cash resources until the next round of dilution, but that's a long way from happening. The recent raise adds over $400,000 to company coffers. The balance sheet as of June 30th shows $1 million in a GIC and another nearly $700,000 in cash with essentially no liabilities. So the company has around $2 million in cash that should last a while, depending on how aggressively it plans to drill or purchase other properties. Prior to the financing, there was approximately 14.5 million shares and 4 million warrants which have a strike of over $1.00. After the financing closed, there is now a total of 18.5 million shares and 8 million warrants.

In an effort to make money and spike sales, the entire market has become one claustrophobic mess of holy-grail It items. But as you and I both know, most of these products don't deserve the jewel-encrusted crown great marketing coronates them with. In my time as a beauty editor, there have only been a few products that truly live up to the hype and buzz that have preceded them, and that pool gets even smaller when it comes to fragranceâ€”a notoriously finicky genre that's so exceptionally personal it almost feels wrong to try to make a recommendation. But last year, after lots of anticipation and countless testimonials gushing over the magnetic olfactive powers of Maison Francis Kurkdjian's famed unisex number, Baccarat Rouge 540, I finally got my hands on a bottle. And let me just say, that first-ever sniff felt like a borderline religious experience. It's hard to call a perfume perfectâ€”the most bewitching perfumes are typically anything butâ€”and scent preference is incredibly subjective, but Baccarat Rouge 540 comes pretty damn close. It's dazzling, and a few hours post-spritz, I knew I was dealing with a true masterpiece. So, yes, the glowing orb of obsession it's inspired since its 2015 inception feels about right. Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum $645 at Nordstrom Born from the relationship between Maison Francis Kurkdjian and Baccarat to celebrate the crystal manufacturer's 250th birthday, Baccarat Rouge 540 is a very special perfume, carefully crafted with very special ingredients. And it will cost you a pretty pennyâ€”$325 worth if we're being exact. The woody scent releases a poetic alchemy, a highly condensed and graphic olfactory signature, the brand muses on its website. Breezy jasmine facets and radiant saffron boost the ambergris mineral notes and the woody tones of freshly-cut cedar. Bright and sleek, Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum caresses the skin like an amber and woody floral whisper. I mean, who doesn't want to be caressed by an amber and woody floral whisper? Even though I highly recommend MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 as a very worthy investment at some point in your life, I understand that sometimes your budget doesn't allow that kind of splurge at the moment. So I've done the good deed of finding 10 very similar contenders that give off the same expensive and wonderfully poetic vibes. Keep scrolling for the best affordable scents similar to Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540. #1: Dossier Ambery Saffron When it comes to the products Marie Claire recommends, we take your faith in us seriously. Every product that we feature comes recommended by a MC writer or editor, or by an expert we've spoken to. Learn more about how we review products. Dossier Ambery Saffron $49 at Dossier Key notes: saffron, orange blossom, jasmine, plum, cedarwood, oakmoss, fir balsam, amber This is not a drill. The magic of Dossier lies in the fact that the brand intentionally brings you scarily similar iterations of the most iconic perfumes in the industry for a fraction of the price. And, you guessed it, this is the brand's dreamy lookalike of MFK's Baccarat Rouge 540 for one-sixth of the investment. The sizzling mixture of amber, cedar, and saffron is uncannily perfect. Customer Review: This is my second time buying this perfume and I absolutely love it. My coworker always compliments me saying it smells yummy and my husband loves it on me!! I will be buying it again when I inevitably run out of it :)read more about review content This is my second time buying this. #2: Glossier You Solid $30 at Glossier Key notes: ambrox, ambrette, musk, iris root, pink pepper Glossier You is already an iconic fragrance in its own right, and it definitely has to be in my top 10 favorite perfumes of all time. The brand recently relaunched the scent in solid form, so you can bask in its milky, ambery, musky perfection anytime, anywhere. Customer Review: It is such a cute compact and it smells great. #3: DedCool Fragrance 04 $90 at Dedcool Key notes: fig, pepper, orange, lemon, sandalwood, patchouli I'm a huge DedCool stan. I love the brand's commitment to clean, no-BS formulations, and every single perfume is holy-shit good. Baccarat Rouge 540 is known for its musky, gender-neutral aroma via a heady mix of woody amber florals, and Fragrance 04 comes pretty dang close. It's musky, woodsy, rich, and the perfect signature scent if you're in the market for a new one. Customer Review: It started out with me wearing it and my husband asking what I was wearing. He loved it so much, he started wearing it. We just had the sample. But, he loved it so much that I bought him a full size bottle. It has become his favorite cologne. It is woodsy and a bit more masculine. Very clean scent. It is his favorite. #4: Boy Smells Flor de la Virgen Genderful Fine Fragrance Boy Smells Flor de La Virgen Genderful Fine Fragrance $98 at Nordstrom Key notes: pomelo, saffron, lemon rind, fig leaf, ivy leaves, jasmine petals, olibanum, cistus, labdanum, clear musks, ambrox It took me days, maybe weeks, to pin down this sparkling scent as my favorite within Boy Smells' new fine fragrance collection. Alas, I finally did, and it's really no surprise it has some glaring similarities to Baccarat Rouge 540, one of my absolute favorite scents of all time. It glistens with juicy, lemon-tinged saffron, jasmine, musk, and ambrox. It still has that quintessential hint of woodiness but leans a little more floral and delicate. Customer Review: I am a huge Boy Smells fan and had high hopes for their perfumes. This does not disappoint, it is a light, summery, and extremely floral scentâ€”exactly as it's described! It is really long-lasting which I love and a little goes a long way. The packaging is really lovely, but not for everyone's tasteâ€”its not a subtle bottle you can carry around easily! I would highly recommend and will personally be buying more Boy Smells perfumes in the future. #5: Ellis Brooklyn Super Amber Eau de Parfum Ellis Brooklyn Super Amber Eau de Parfum $108 at Revolve Key notes: amber, cedarwood, vanilla orchid, and biodegradable musk If it's the amber aspect of Baccarat that pulls you in, I recommend taking Ellis Brooklyn's fan-favorite Super Amber for a spin. MFK's Baccarat Rouge 540 makes every editor I know start drooling, and this velvety scent has the same hypnotizing effect. That said, it's a litter warmer and sweeter since it lacks the floral aspect you can subtly detect in its pricier counterpart. Customer Review: The perfect cozy amber scent. It wasn't love at first sniffâ€”it definitely has to sit on the skin for a few moments to warm up. It's subtle but noticeable and surprisingly I get tons of compliments on this. A stranger even asked me to write down the name so he could buy it for his girlfriend! #6: St. Rose Circa 91 Eau de Parfum St. Rose Circa 91 Eau de Parfum $185 at Bergorf Goodman Key notes: lemon, bergamot, patchouli, iris, jasmine, sandalwood, cedarwood If you have yet to dip your toe into the clean, sustainably made fragrance universe of St. Rose, consider this the perfect time.

Introduction In a 1959 editorial on the â€˜precautions taken against' bacterial contamination of blood products, a subject of the 7th ISBT Conference in Rome of that year, JD James wrote â€˜a mere stroke of cruel chance may lead to tragedy' [ 1 ]. This statement still rings true today as transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis (TABS) remains a serious issue for blood services internationally. The measures in variable use and/or recommended at that time in Europe included single-use sterilised equipment and collection bottles, skin disinfection with ether soap followed by 70% alcohol with chlorhexidine, avoidance of blood bottle manipulation after collection and processing, refrigeration of whole blood at 4 Â°C, inspection for signs of gross contamination, and investigation and reporting of contamination events, all of which led to enhanced safety of blood transfusion at the time [ 1 , 2 ].

The noise over time got progressively worse and at 14 months Kia replaced the engine. When the original engine was removed it was noted in a report that there was damage inside: cylinder bores scratched, oil residue on pistons, piston ring failure. The service centre manager said the damage was like that or a 10 year old car! 2 weeks into having the new engine and the noise was back. That was fitted in April this year and the noise now is just as bad, if not worse. Kia Australia are stating now that that noise is a characteristic of this model or car.

Di seguito vi propongo il mio intervento. ONGOING WARS, KANT AND THE PATH OF WORLD PEACE Two wars in the space of three years may seem to belie the narrative of a more stable and peaceful multipolar world compared to the era of American tutelage that preceded it. For the nostalgic of the days of Uncle Sam's hegemony, these two conflicts may appear to be part of a largely predictable outcome. Ukraine and Israel-Palestine would be leading us toward an international system in the grip of chaos, where anyone can attack, bomb, and destroy an adversary without fearing a reaction from a world security guarantor. In my perspective, the deeper meaning of the ongoing wars contradicts the prevailing rhetoric of the prophets of doom, who speak of a post-American Armageddon that will make us nostalgic of the days of the Cold War and post-1989 unipolar rule. These conflicts do not mark the beginning of a process that - from crisis to crisis, from genocide to genocide, from mass violence to mass violence - will culminate in a third world war and a revamped barbarization of foreign affairs. Rather, they are a backlash, a reaction to the progress made in the international system over decades that will persist despite the massacres and horrors perpetrated by the powers and interests under threat. I will take the Middle East and the BRICS as examples. In recent years, the BRICS have gained global attention as the nucleus of a new, more just and inclusive world order. An order that is composed of several cultures, civilizations, religions and societies. An order that is free of mortal enemies, where there are no hostile blocs, open to solidarity and cooperation among peoples, and based on respect for identities and sovereignties. A non-militaristic, non-colonialist system whose economy is far from classical capitalism. In BRICS countries, public authority - the state - is not subservient to economic power; instead, the dominant model here is the Developmental State where the state directs markets and socioeconomic development. The combined GDP of the BRICS now exceeds that of the G7, who make up only 6 percent of the world population compared to the BRICS' 41 percent. Almost all states are not engaged in an arms race, but are rather focused on a race for development and prosperity. They no longer see the need for the 800 U.S. military bases spread across the four corners of the earth. For 90 percent of the earth's citizens, the thought of being drawn into a military alliance requiring them to fight someone else's battle thousands of miles away from their homeland is far from their minds. Amidst these days of war and despair, there's often mockery directed at the statement of Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, who, a few weeks before the atrocious Hamas attack on Israeli civilians claimed that the Middle East was experiencing a period of relative calm compared to the previous two decades. This derisive tone is, in fact, entirely misplaced. Sullivan was right. Before October 7, the Middle East stood out as a compelling example of the positive influence of a multipolar world: Saudis and Israelis dialoguing for the first time with U.S. mediation, Turks and Syrians meeting thanks to Moscow. And, most importantly, two historical arch-enemies like the Saudis and Iranians laying down their swords, signing agreements, and reopening embassies with Chinese facilitation. To all this, we must add a relative pause in the bloody war in Yemen, coinciding with a collapse of terrorism and conflict across the broader Middle East - from Afghanistan to Libya to Iraq, following US withdrawal from the region. Regrettably, due to Hamas and Netanyahu this scenario has fallen apart. Hatred and divisions are resurfacing in the region, which some fear may be heading toward a new war instead of an era of de-escalation. Nevertheless, I believe a full-scale clash between the Arab countries and Iran on one side and Israel on the other is unlikely. We won't witness a repeat of the 1973 Yom Kippur war when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israeli armed forces. Egypt has maintained positive relations with Israel, which in turn has been at peace with Jordan since 1994. Today's Syria lacks both the disposition and armaments to take the field. The only two candidates for escalating the conflict appear to be Iran and Hezbollah. However, both have indicated that they are not seeking an all-out military confrontation with Israel. If they had wanted to, they would have directly participated in Hamas' initial attack, which they did not. The only entities inclined toward an existential clash are the Hamas fanatics and the members of the current far-right government in Tel Aviv. Both have everything to lose from the dÃ©tente process that was under way in the Middle East before the October attack. They both oppose the two-state solution and aren't interested in providing a platform for a strong and equitable representation of the Palestinian people. And it is on this ground that they have done nothing but brazenly favor each other in recent years, postponing the confrontation until now, initiated by Hamas, which has beaten Netanyahu's intentions to the punch. Hamas is aware that improvement of relations in the region, along with reduced tensions between the United States and Iran, could undermine its position. Regional distension could allow the two-state project to resurface, along with a waning of foreign support for its militants. In contrast, Netanyahu seeks war because it is the only way to avoid going to jail for corruption and to continue the apartheid against the Palestinians. While an excessively bloody Israeli counteroffensive - such as the one under way - may indeed encourage armed intervention by Iran and its Lebanese Hezbollah allies, the risk of an escalation to a full-scale war between Israel and Iran remains limited, at least for now. Hezbollah, Iran, and Israel have accumulated a reluctance to take such a major risk. That said, what must be kept into account is that all countries involved have thresholds which, if crossed, might lead them to act. However, the specific locations of these thresholds depend very much on the policies of Tel Aviv and Washington and the level of domestic anger and protests against Israel. The major world powers other than the USA are mostly bystanders in this crisis. We shall see. In any case, regardless of the outcome of the ongoing wars, the trajectory of global megatrends working toward peace will not stop. It is a troubled path, full of difficult moments. The advance of multipolarity will reduce conflicts in the medium to long term, but in the short term it will create new ones as old fractures and situations generated by shifting power balances come to the forefront. It was Immanuel Kant who taught us that the course of human progress is not linear but uncertain and discontinuous. Peace can stagnate or recede for even long periods. It can be interrupted by discouraging setbacks, during which people appear to regress without having learned anything. However, Kant ingeniously resolved the contradiction posed by outbreaks of violence in the middle of a peaceful path through the concept of the learning process: a dynamic by which it is precisely humanity's backward falls that end up stimulating ethical progress and peace. This progression through temporary regressions is typical of that imperfectly rational creature that is the human being. An animal capable of learning, albeit slowly and with difficulty, from his own mistakes. According to this Kantian view, the multipolar world, the BRICS and the growth of global security still have a long way to go. The Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts, although painful and unnecessary, are s",neutral,,IT,,,3,ITALY,61,57,8,48,0,0,0,N,,,15380,pinoarlacchi,Pino Arlacchi{169855586412134},1,0,0,0,0,0,,,997,0,0,T00,,,P

This article is supported by the ESET Foundation, whose annual ESET Science Award recognises exceptional scientists. Polymer chemist Igor LacÃ­k from the Polymer Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences wants to further advance the treatment of diabetes and improve the lives of the many people who live with it. That's why he is studying the use of polymer materials in the treatment of this disease. In addition, scientists under his guidance are also synthesising water-soluble polymers. Until recently, this area of research was plagued by uncertainties. Thanks to the contribution of Igor LacÃ­k, that has changed. Turn off ads Article continues after video advertisement This year, his work was recognised by the international jury of the ESET Science Award, headed by the Nobel laureate Michel Mayor, and Igor LacÃ­k was announced the winner in the Outstanding Scientist in Slovakia category. The award aims to highlight the work and role of scientists in Slovakia. The Slovak Spectator talked to LacÃ­k about his scientific work, the use of polymers in the treatment of diabetes, cells that resemble islets, and how he got into research.

A century-old idea For the human body, the hormone insulin is absolutely necessary. It mediates the transfer of glucose â€“ i.e. blood sugar, the main power source for cells â€“ from blood to cells. If it is absent, or if its activity is impaired, diabetes occurs. The discovery of the hormone and its subsequent production has saved of millions of lives around the world since the 1920s. Turn off ads Treatment of diabetes is constantly evolving and is widely provided in Slovakia. However, in a small but still significant group of patients, current treatment is not able to control sugar levels. These patients typically have hyperglycaemia, i.e. a high blood sugar level, or hypoglycaemia, i.e. a low blood sugar level. In the case of the latter, patients usually experience clinical symptoms, such as tremors, sweating, etc. They can even experience severe sugar cravings. My [diabetic] friend dreams that he is eating Horalka [a traditional sweet wafer snack - Ed. note], LacÃ­k says. In addition, there is a group of people with uncontrolled hypoglycaemia who do not experience such symptoms that tell them they need sugar. They may have to wake up at night several times to check their sugar level, for fear of slipping into a coma, are hence in constant stress. In their case, the pumps that deliver precise doses of insulin do not work. There are also patients whose pancreas, the organ that produces insulin, needs to be removed for health reasons. They then become diabetics. Last but not least, there are also patients who end up needing kidney transplants, because this is one of the first organs to fail as a result of diabetes. For these three groups, cell therapy in the form of pancreatic islet transplantation is one way to go. These are clusters of cells that make up roughly two percent of the pancreas' volume. The clusters contain several types of cells, but for the purposes of the treatment, two are important: alpha cells that produce glucagon, a hormone that increases sugar levels, and beta cells, which produce insulin. When insulin was first discovered, more than a hundred years ago, the islet transplantation was considered â€“ but the success rate was low and it was considered a failure. Now, 60 percent of patients with transplanted islets function like healthy people. In terms of sugar control, transplanted islets effectively act as your own pancreas, LacÃ­k explains. Functional islets are isolated from the pancreas. If the organ has to be removed from the patient, then the islets can be isolated from it; otherwise they are taken from the pancreas of a deceased donor. In the case of the latter, there is a selection process, but it is not as strict as with organs, so there are potentially more donors. Still, immunosuppressants are subsequently necessary, since the islets represent tissue from a different body, that is connected with the rejection of islets. Related article The Slovak chemist who wants to help men avoid a painful procedure Read more The road to curing diabetes When the co-discoverer of insulin, Frederick Banting, received the Nobel Prize in 1923, he said that insulin was only a treatment, not a cure: Currently, it is said that if the islets can be transplanted in such a way that immunosuppressants would not be necessary, then we would have a functional cure. So yes, we would cure diabetes. The immune system would not intervene; a patient would be able to have their sugar level controlled without drugs. That would be a big milestone. Transplantation is a one-day outpatient procedure. Isolated islets are injected into the liver through the organ's entrance vein. They then disperse into the bloodstream, where they react to sugar levels and release hormones accordingly. If a patient is to avoid immunosuppressants, the transplanted islets must be isolated from the immune system. This is where Igor LacÃ­k's polymer research comes into play. We wrap them in a semi-permeable polymer membrane, one that would allow the penetration of glucose without restriction and at the same time permit the secretion of hormones. Moreover, in order for the islets to survive for a long time, i.e. for at least months and years, nutrients, oxygen and must also get to them and metabolites need to be released. At the same time, the immune system must not get in, otherwise it would destroy them, LacÃ­k explains as he describes his research. If the islets stop working after a certain time, they can be transplanted again. We have to find a polymer that fulfils all of these attributes. It also needs to be biocompatible, which means the body will not recognize it and will not, therefore, want to get rid of it. We want it to become friends with the islets, not to be toxic to them. We have to ensure that the polymer membrane is also stable during the functioning of the islets. LacÃ­k's team uses hydrogel spheres with a diameter of up to one millimetre for transplantation. These are either various polysaccharides, or a combination of polysaccharides and synthetic polymers, which in mouse models meet all the attributes set out by LacÃ­k. However, some experiments in primates were successful, while others were not. As a result, the tests have currently been suspended and his team is adjusting the properties of the polymers. At the moment, the whole world is trying to improve this polymer so that we have a material that works for a long time, he says. From left: Igor LacÃ­k, Nobel Prize laureate Michel Mayor and ESET CEO Richard Marko (Source: ESET Science Award/Linda KiskovÃ¡ BohuÅ¡ovÃ¡) At what stage is the research? Although the principle is simple, according to LacÃ­k, we are still not at the stage where a doctor can recommend a finished product to their patients. Scientists still do not fully understand the details of how, when and why the islets survive, how to properly set biocompatibility, and so on.

Weather Iconic 1962 race car becomes most expensive Ferrari ever sold at auction The Holy Grail hypercar has a legendary status on the racing track and has been dubbed a once-in-a-generation chance acquisition. By Aaliyah Harris, news reporter Tuesday 14 November 2023 14:51, UK Image: The hypercar was previously owned by a chairman of the Ferrari Club of America. Pic: Sotheby's Why you can trust Sky News A 1962 Ferrari has sold for a record $51.7m (Â£42m) at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The striking red 330 LM/250 GTO model, which is the only GTO Tipo 1962 to have been raced by Formula 1's Scuderia Ferrari , has become the most valuable Ferrari and the second highest priced car to be sold at auction. Dubbed a once-in-a-generation chance purchase, the iconic vehicle - which was given the chassis number 3765 - was claimed by its new owner after nearly four decades in private ownership. Alongside making sales history, the model has a legendary status on the racing track having won second place at the 1962 NÃ¼rburgring 1,000km in Germany and was placed second in the GTO class at the 2011 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. The Holy Grail hypercar was previously owned by a chairman of the Ferrari Club of America. Image: Pic: Sotheby's It won an FCA Platinum Award, the Coppa Bella Macchina at the Cavallino Classic and received a Best of Show at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in Florida. Mike Parkes and Lorenzo Bandini piloted the car for Scuderia Ferrari at the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans race, and it also secured the position of runner-up in the 1965 Sicilian Hillclimb Championship.

DAB Bolivia works tirelessly to empower indigenous artisans, young designers, and communities through various initiatives, including the annual DAB Bolivia design festival. The DAB Bolivia design festival is a unique event that provides a platform for Bolivian artisans to showcase their exquisite handmade creations. The festival also features workshops and seminars that give visitors the opportunity to learn about the rich history and cultural significance of Bolivian crafts, food, fashion, design and more. I believe that it is essential to learn about, share, and support indigenous, artisan, and young talent in Bolivia and around the world. This kind of support helps to preserve the country's cultural heritage and ensures that these traditional crafts continue to be passed down from generation to generation. Dedicated to preserving and promoting Bolivian culture, the DAB Bolivia design festival is a truly inspiring event that will leave you feeling proud to support Bolivian and international creativity. With the participation of super talented designers like @gypsysport and @artisan_acby, @ana_palza @deannacanedopatino along with renowned editors @joseforteza, @kellytalamas, and @camistraschnoy, this festival is not to be missed. #DABBolivia #designfestival #indigenous #artisan #youngtalent #Bolivia #creativity #culture #heritage ",positive,,EN,,,"4,5",UNKNOWN,38,448,0,428,0,20,0,N,,https://extreme-img-rep.web-live.it/storage/2023/11/15/BDCF09F54BEF5CA9B651C6BE0008DC643B5A64D81808AB6408A2D24D3B181B1F.jpg,0,mrpatrickduffy,mrpatrickduffy{194880045},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1792,0,0,P00,,,P

How can the slow concept of knipselbonen be used in our rapid time? How can agricultural bean waste be used as nutrition and a base for new biomaterials?

La collezione mira a creare sinergie tra le arti e le nuove tecnologie e afferma i-Mesh come una tecnologia creativa a disposizione degli artisti. A pochi anni dalla sua scomparsa, l'esposizione rende inoltre omaggio a Cristiano Toraldo di Francia, proseguendo il percorso iniziato con Fiorenzi nel 2017. L'architetto italiano ha infatti contribuito con la sua fama ad aiutare i-Mesh ad avviare riflessioni sull'Architettura Morbida, proprio attraverso la metafora dell'arazzo e la flessibilitÃ  dei suoi materiali e sistemi produttivi. Arazzi Contemporanei â€“ With its softness, beauty and expressive power, i-Mesh also touches the art world with this art collection curated by Alberto Fiorenzi - the founder of i-Mesh - and started with the contribution of Cristiano Toraldo di Francia and Cristiana Colli. The collection aims to create synergies between the arts and new technologies and affirms i-Mesh as a creative technology available to artists. A few years after his death, the exhibition also pays tribute to Cristiano Toraldo di Francia, continuing the path begun with Fiorenzi in 2017. The Italian architect has in fact contributed with his fame to help i-Mesh to initiate reflections on Soft Architecture, precisely through the metaphor of the tapestry and the flexibility of its materials and production systems.

1221919724,WWW.ANDROIDPOLICE.COM,11/6/2023,NEWS,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-8-vs-oneplus-11/,Google Pixel 8 vs. OnePlus 11: The battle of affordable flagships,"Google Pixel 8 vs. OnePlus 11: The battle of affordable flagships Google's new small flagship takes on OnePlus's value and performance king Google's new small flagship takes on OnePlus's value and performance king USB-C Design Both the Pixel 8 and the OnePlus 11 are essentially glass sandwiches â€” with very distinct designs. Google has kept the same design language as the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 7 for the Pixel 8, but in order to refresh things a bit, the company tweaked a few elements. For example, the Pixel 8 has more rounded corners, and the lenses now seemingly occupy more space in the camera bar than the previous generations. Otherwise, the phone has an all-screen front with a centered hole-punch selfie camera design, an aluminum chassis, a slim profile, and an all-width camera bar. The OnePlus 11 front, although quite similar to the Pixel 8, has a left-aligned hole-punch cutout and even slimmer bezels. It's the camera module that looks strikingly different from the Google phone. Instead of a large horizontal bar' the Chinese smartphone maker has opted for a circular camera bump, which melts into the phone's frame. In other design highlights, the Pixel is IP68-rated and can handle up to 1.5-meter deep water for 30 minutes, while the OnePlus 11 only has IP64 certification, which is essentially splash-resistance. The OnePlus flagship is also heavier at 205 grams, compared to Pixel's 187 grams. Display Although the Pixel 8 and OnePlus 11 both use OLED panels, the phones have different screen sizes and resolutions. Google uses a 6.2-inch full-HD screen, and OnePlus has gone with a 6.7-inch QHD panel. The good news is that the lower resolution will help the Pixel 8 in the battery department since it has a smaller battery than the OnePlus phone. In other display specifications, each phone has a 120Hz refresh rate screen, but while the OnePlus 11 display can do 1Hz to 120Hz as required, the Google phone has a more limited 60Hz to 120Hz range. Moreover, you get support for both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ with the OnePlus offering, whereas the Google product is HDR10+ only. The saving grace for the Pixel display is its higher 2,000 nits peak brightness, but you rarely see it in action. The OnePlus 11 can reach up to 1,300 nits peak brightness, which is also decent. Cameras Camera performance is one category where Google has dominated with its Pixel phones, thanks to its computational photography prowess. The Pixel 8 will undoubtedly deliver better camera performance than the OnePlus 11. Moreover, the camera app for Pixel phones has been redesigned and includes features like Best Take. The primary shooter on the OnePlus 11 can take solid pictures in most lighting conditions, but you'll need a steady hand in low-light scenarios. The OnePlus phone is also decent at video recording and taking selfies, though it delivers nothing exceptional and suffers from inconsistency. In terms of camera specifications, the Pixel 8 uses a 50MP primary shooter with f/1.68, a 12MP ultrawide camera with f/2.2 aperture and a 125.8-degree field of view, and a 10.5MP front shooter with f/2.2 aperture. On the other hand, the OnePlus 11 features a 50MP primary camera with f/1.8 aperture, a 32MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom and f/2.0 aperture, a 48MP ultrawide camera with 115-degree field of view, and a 16MP selfie shooter with f/2.5 aperture. Performance and battery This is where it gets a bit tricky as we haven't had a chance to run our full suite of tests on the Pixel 8, so we don't know whether it will pip the OnePlus 11 in performance and battery life. However, given the Tensor G3 is a flagship-grade processor, we can expect it to deliver a snappy and responsive performance, just like the Tensor G2 offers on the Pixel 7 . The presence of 8GB of RAM will certainly help. The OnePlus 11, in contrast, has a much more tried and tested Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. We already know it delivers a rocking performance on the phone whether you are doing everyday tasks or playing a graphics-intensive game like the Genshin Impact. Like the Pixel 8, it also packs 8GB of RAM in the base model. Yes, you can shell out more for 16GB RAM, which is an overkill but will undoubtedly keep the phone running smoothly for years. In addition, the 16GB RAM variant comes with the faster UFS 4.0 storage, while both Pixel 8 versions have the UFS 3.1 storage. The 4.1 storage won't result in a noticeable difference right now; however, it will make the OnePlus 11 a little more future-proof. In other features, the USB Type-C port on the Google phone is rated for USB 3.2, unlike the USB-C port on the OnePlus 11, which tops out at USB 2.0. So, if you transfer data frequently to and from the phone, the Pixel 8 will make your task much faster. Battery life In terms of the battery, the OnePlus 11 has a bigger 5,000 battery. As our review showed , the phone's battery life is not impacted much, despite the phone's larger display and higher resolution panel. It can easily run for two days on moderate use, plus it has the 80W fast-wired charging going in its favor. In comparison, the Pixel 8 houses a 4575mAh battery. In Google's estimates, it lasts around 31 hours with medium usage. Moreover, it only supports 27W fast charging, like its predecessor. The Google phone does have one advantage on its side in the form of wireless charging support, which is missing from the OnePlus phone. If you love the convenience of wireless charging, it's an easy decision. And with the official Pixel Stand (2nd Gen), you can enjoy 18W fast wireless charging. Software Android has matured quite a bit. Consequently, the software version of a phone and the manufacturer's own play on Android don't get that big of a consideration in people's purchase decisions. However, it's still an essential part of a phone's experience. Pixel 8, as you can expect, comes with Android 14 out of the box. What sets Pixel phones apart from other Android phones is Google's implementation of AI tweaks, which keep increasing each year. Thanks to the powerful Tensor G3 processor, the Pixel 8 can run even more complex machine-learning models than its predecessors. This means that it'll be better at removing unwanted background noise from your calls, filtering spam calls, and making video recordings by improving their audio. The Pixel 8 can also seamlessly switch between languages during voice transcription and offer summaries of articles in Chrome and Google app, among other AI-enhanced features. OnePlus 11, on the other hand, runs on Android 13-based OxygenOS 13. Like the Pixel, it has its own tricks, yet you miss out on Pixel-specific AI goodness. But more importantly, the company has fixed many of the software issues that plagued the OnePlus 10, and this ColorOS-infused OxygenOS version is more palatable. Software updates One of the big highlights of the Pixel 8 launch event was the revelation that the 8 series will get OS and security updates for seven long years. This is a first in the Android world. The Pixel 8 wins by a significant margin over the OnePlus 11, at least in the software support category. The OnePlus 11 will get four Android OS updates and five years of security updates. This is not shabby, but it can't compete with Google's promise. The right phone for you Choosing between the Google Pixel 8 and the OnePlus 11 will depend on which features are most important to you. The Pixel 8, which has much going for it, comes with better camera performance, a longer software support period, a capable processor, tons of AI-powered features, and wireless charging support. If these features are essential to you, the Pixel 8 is an easy decision. Source: Google Editor's pick The Pixel goodness The Pixel 8 is an all-around excellent smartphone packed with Google's AI tweaks. And you'll be hard-pressed to find fault in the phone's camera performance. $699 at Amazon $699 at Google Store $699 at Best Buy The OnePlus 11 has a bigger and higher resolution screen with more features, a larger battery for a higher uptime, and a",positive,,EN,,,"2,81",ITALY,4189,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-pixel-8.png,2694704,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,808411,0,0,P01,,,P

Follow Us as With the Pixel 7 series, Google came back stronger to beat all rivals in terms of photography in 2022. This year, the Pixel 8 series has been upgraded with an even better camera and the device is powered by the next-gen Tensor G3 silicon, faster-charging capability and more. I spent a little over two weeks with the Pixel 8 and here are my thoughts on Google's latest smartphone. Design, build quality and display Google has retained the core design elements of the Pixel 7 for the Pixel 8 series. You can see how similar they are and if you look closer, there are subtle changes in dimensions (height and width). Also, the new model is lighter in weight but thicker than the predecessor. And, the camera module in the trademark metallic visor on the back of the Pixel 8 is bigger compared to the Pixel 7. Google Pixel 8 (left) Pixel 7 (right) Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit The device's glass cover on the back beautifully blends with the metallic rail and the colour scheme too, is great. The sombre Obsidian colour variant looks prettier to the eyes thanks to curvaceous corners and a glossy finish. The matte finish on the camera visor and rails around the edge adds value to the visual appeal. Google Pixel 8 (left) and the Pixel 7 (right). Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit Besides the Obsidian variant, Google offers the Pixel 8 in two other colours-- Hazel and Rose. Pixel 8 is not just a pretty phone, it is also eco-friendly. The aircraft-grade aluminium used in the phone is 100 per cent recycled. Even the glass and plastic used for the Pixel 8 (& 8 Pro) are said to be 100 per cent re-purposed. Google Pixel 8. Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit The latest Google phone is built to last longer too. The display is protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus shield and can resist scratches from coins or pens when placed close to each other in a pant pocket. Add to that, it also comes with IP68 rating, meaning the device can survive any accidental splashes of water or even moderate rain (for a few minutes) and even a dip in the swimming pool for up to 1.5 metres (around five feet) for close to 30 minutes. Google Pixel 8 (bottom) Pixel 7 (top) Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit On the front, it houses a 6.2-inch full HD+ OLED display. Google likes to call it a 'Super Actua display'. It is the brightest screen on a pixel phone to date and as advertised, it is really good. It can support variable refresh rate (60Hz-120Hz) and peak brightness of 2,000 nits, At full brightness, you can read the news or scroll through social media apps without having to squint your eyes when outdoors. Also, when watching high-quality nature docuseries, the colours particularly those of birds of paradise look vibrant. Even while viewing movies such as the KGF series or The Batman trilogy (by Christopher Nolan) with dark backgrounds, you will appreciate how good the display is on the Pixel 8 series. Google Pixel 8. Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit The speakers too, they are great and easily liven up any regular room of a house with good music and there is less distortion even with volume put to max. As far as the on-screen fingerprint sensor is concerned, it works fine. But, you have to keep the finger dry and clean for it to avoid false rejection. Performance As noted earlier, Pixel 8 (& 8 Pro) come with 64-bit Tensor G3 chipset with 8GB LPDDR5X RAM and is available with just 128GB storage option in India. As advertised, the Tensor G3 sensor does great with better on-device machine learning capabilities to power live translations, and better and faster response from Google Assistant to user queries. Even with advanced computational photography editing tools such as the new magic editor, audio eraser, the best take, and magic eraser, the Pixel phone works like a charm (more on that later). For journalists like me, Pixel 8 and even previous iterations, are amazing at live translations and transcribing. Especially with the latter aspect, it saved me a lot of time in finishing an interview story. Previously, I used to take several hours to get the hang of the accent and words the person said. Google Pixel 8. Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit Pixel 8 was able to capture every minute pauses and the time stamps were even more helpful to edit the interview. Thankfully with Tensor G3-powered Pixel 8's magical transcriber feature, I was able to finish the edited excerpts and publish the story in less than two hours. However, Pixel 8 exhibits lag-ness and gets warmed easily while playing graphics-rich games. Also, while processing the images, it takes some time. But, it is worth the wait. While doing day-to-day tasks, it just waltzed through the day without any issues. Google Pixel 8. Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit It runs on vanilla Android 14 and the interface is so clean, tailor-made for purists like me. There is no complication at all and no bloatware too. And, what's amazing is that Google is promising to offer seven years of OS updates; that's up to 2030. I am not sure people will hold on to a phone for more than three or four years, but this guarantee gives us hope that the after-sales service centres will readily have spare parts of the device and there will be less waiting time. As far as the battery life is concerned, the device under normal usage, can easily last a day, provided it has stable Wi-Fi connectivity at home and the office. But, if you are out of the city and fully dependent on cellular data for multimedia consumption and apps' usage all day, then, you need to have a power bank as a backup. This year, the Pixel 8 comes with faster 27W charging capability than the Pixel 7 (20W). Also, it supports 18W wireless charging and reverse charging. Photography The Pixel 8 features an all-new and bigger dual-camera module--50MP wide (1/1.3-inch Samsung GN2 sensor, LDAF, f/1.68) + 12MP ultra-wide sensor(125-degree FoV, Sony IMX386 sensor, f/2.2, macro option)-- with OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation), EIS (Electronic Image Stabilisation) and LED flash on the rear side. Camera sample of Google Pixel 8. Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit It takes fantastic pictures in all light conditions. I just state here straight off the bat that the Pixel 8 is the best among all the premium phones. Of course, the 8 Pro will be even better. Camera sample of Google Pixel 8. Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit The Pixel 8 aces in terms of capturing the images with so much clarity and detail. For instance, this lizard with camouflage matching the granite stone colour is so well captured. Even when you zoom in on a big computer screen, there is hardly any noise.

Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit Even at night, the lights of the top ceiling of the magnificent structure are captured with great finesse. I have seen some premium phones struggle to balance the light of the street lamp. Also, with the Ultra-HDR feature, the photos in low light look great with rich colour, darker shadows, and there are brighter highlights on the subject. Camera sample of Google Pixel 8 captured indoors with limited lighting. Credit: DH Photo/KVN Rohit With wide-angle mode, the Pixel 8 manages to capture wide areas without any artificial bending of structures, to accommodate them within the frame. Also, the colours look natural. Camera sample of Google Pixel 8 with ultra wide angle mode.

The Google Pixel 8 is a superb small(ish) smartphone with top specs, great screen, incredible camera, and seven years of software support What we love Small size for a modern phone Good quality screen Seven years of software updates What we don't 90Hz refresh rate Excellently bright The Pixel 8 has a flat 6.2-inch screen, which is a little smaller than on the Pixel 7 . With a slightly narrow aspect ratio, it's a good size screen for one handed use, but you'll still need large hands to be able to type with just one thumb. The 6.2-inch screen is bright, sharp, and crisp (Image: Google) The screen is a very good quality OLED panel with a 1080x2400 resolution and excellent brightness - there's no issue reading anything in direct sunlight, and the system boosts the brightness up to a higher level if the sun is really bearing down on you. Apps, menus, and texts scroll by smoothly thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate display, though this is not as slick looking as the faster 120Hz screen on the Pixel 8 Pro, which is better but comes on a phone that costs Â£300 more. Colour reproduction is sharp and vivid, with deep blacks and bright whites, meaning despite its smaller size, the Pixel 8 is a wonderful phone on which to view photos, watch YouTube videos, read news, and browse social media. Camera Ultrawide lens AI editing features Previous Pixels have been rightly praised for their amazingly good cameras, and we are pleased to report that the Pixel 8 is no exception. It doesn't have the telephoto lens of the 8 Pro and has a different ultrawide lens to that phone, but it thankfully shares the same astonishingly good 50Mp main camera sensor. Here are some of our favourite shots we captured using the Pixel 8: Google Pixel 8 camera sample (Image: EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS) Google Pixel 8 camera sample (Image: EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS) Previous Pixels have been rightly praised for their amazingly good cameras, and we are pleased to report that the Pixel 8 is no exception Google Pixel 8 camera sample (Image: EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS) Google Pixel 8 camera sample (Image: EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS) The main camera is so good that we took more photos than when we had another phone in our pockets - always a sign that a camera is doing something special. The portrait mode is very good, too. The photos take on a vibrant, contrast-heavy look that we love, with images we were as pleased with when tested side by side against the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which costs Â£1,199 - Â£500 more than the Pixel 8. It's definitely not Â£500 better. But that iPhone and the Pixel 8 Pro both have dedicated optical telephoto lenses, something the smaller Pixel 8 lacks. Thanks to Google's clever Super Res Zoom software, you can zoom in 2x and shots still look great, but when you go to the maximum 8x, things look a bit ropey as it's relying on digital zooming. The 12Mp ultrawide camera is nice to have to get more in the frame when you're up close to a building, or to take in a wider view of, well, a view: Google Pixel 8 camera sample (Image: Google) The 10.5Mp selfie camera also produces punchy, usable shots for social media and has a digital crop so you can take a slightly wider view if needed for group shots. If you're into editing, Google is pushing artificial intelligence (AI) photo editing features hard with the Pixel 8. One that works very well is called Best Take - snap several pictures of a group of people, and there might be one great one except one person is blinking. You can use Best Take to swap out the faces of those people, picking the ones where everyone is smiling and looking at the camera. It's borderline creepy as it works so well, but it's using actual images of people, not creating them, so we give it a thumbs up. Google is pushing artificial intelligence (AI) photo editing features hard with the Pixel 8 Less convincing is Magic Editor, which says it can erase people from photos or move them around in the frame. It works much less consistently, and has limits on what it will let you do, as though Google is weakly applying some ethics to image manipulation behind the scenes. Do it or don't, Google! Little things like the phone automatically unblurring faces using AI are the things that quietly make this one of the best cameras on a phone. Performance and battery life 8GB RAM 128/256GB storage Google is using its own Tensor G3 chipset in the Pixel 8. It's powerful enough for everyday tasks and can handle high-end games like Genshin Impact, but it's not as smooth-running as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in phones like the Galaxy S23 Ultra. It shows its weaker side when using AI tools like Magic Editor. Editing photos sees the feature creak under the computing load and takes a good few seconds to render images. It feels slow. The Pixel 8 has great performance and specs for the price (Image: Google) Otherwise everything ticks along nicely with 8GB RAM, and multi-tasking between several open apps for work and play feels fluid and zippy. The base model Pixel 8 comes with 128GB storage, or you can pay Â£60 more for 256GB - we'd recommend doing this so you can fill up on photos, videos, and apps without running out of space. With a 4,575mAh battery, the Pixel lasts a full day on a charge, but a two-day phone this is not. It can charge at a relatively slow 27W, though you can get to 50 percent in half an hour with the right charger (there's only a USB-C cable in the box). You can also pop the Pixel on a wireless charging pad, but it'll juice up at an even slower 18W. Software Pixel-exclusive features Seven years of updates The Pixel 8 has Android 14 at launch, the latest version of Google's mobile operating system. It's our favourite flavour of Android - less cluttered than Samsung's One UI and prettier to boot. Google has made the software more customisable than ever thanks to tons of wallpaper options, including an AI wallpaper maker so you can have a completely unique, AI generated look to your phone. You can pick the colour palette of app icons, menus, and the whole system far beyond what Apple will let you do with an iPhone. The Pixel feels very personal, which we love. It's our favourite flavour of Android - less cluttered than Samsung's One UI and prettier to boot Though not every country gets it, in the UK the Pixel can use the clever Call Screen feature where you can get the phone to screen calls for you, using an AI generated voice to ask them why they are calling, with the transcript shown on screen so you can decide whether to pick up the phone. It's handy if you get a lot of spam calls. The Pixel also has Live Translate, a feature in the Google Translate app that can translate a live conversation between people speaking two different languages. The Tensor chip does this very fast, as fast as it can transcribe a conversation in the Recorder app, too. We used the transcription feature in Google Docs to dictate entire articles - it's that good. Best of all, Google is promising seven years of Android and security updates for the Pixel 8, meaning it'll be supported in 2030. Whether or not the phone's hardware would have ground to a halt then is another matter, but it's great to see, and a",positive,,EN,,,4,UNITED KINGDOM,1294,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/59/1200x712/5056951.jpg,175438,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,52631,0,0,N00,,,P

Here's what to know about the new Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro cameras. Google Pixel 8 cameras: Specs, features, and more As always, Google has more than a few goodies in store. By November 6, 2023 Ryan Haines / Android Authority When you think of a Google Pixel device, you probably think of a few things: clean software, frequent updates, and Google Assistant hiding in every last corner of the phone. However, there's one feature you probably think of before the rest â€” the cameras. Google practically built its Pixel brand on powerful image processing, often choosing software tweaks over upgrading the camera sensors. Those days are behind us. Now, Google's flagships have the hardware chops to match their lofty software skills, and here are all of the new Google Pixel 8 camera features to know about. Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro camera: Hardware features Ryan Haines / Android Authority Google's strength still lies in its Tensor G3-powered software, but we're not here to eat dessert first. Instead, we should probably start with the updated sensors on both the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro . The latter picked up more upgrades than the former, but both devices have a few tweaks in store. Take a quick look at the table below for the hardware basics before we jump into the specifics. Google Pixel 8 - 20mm equivalent - 1.22Âµm pixels Let's start with the Pixel 8, mainly because it didn't receive as much camera love as its Pro-level counterpart. Google's base-level flagship is still one of the best phones you can buy, and it packs the same 50MP primary sensor as its predecessor, though it offers a slightly wider maximum aperture of f/1.7 instead of the Pixel 7's max of f/1.9. This means the Pixel 8 should be more capable in Night Sight situations, allowing more light to hit the sensor. The Pixel 8 still tops out at 8x zoom, which Google calls Super Res Zoom, and supports single-zone LDAF focusing. Google's 50MP primary sensor is still paired with a trusty 12MP ultrawide camera, but it offers a much wider field of view than before. The Pixel 8 offers a 126-degree field of view â€” a significant bump from the previous 114-degree mark. Outside of the wider picture, however, the Pixel 8's ultrawide sensor still offers the same f/2.2 maximum aperture as its predecessor. The Pixel 8's primary camera also tackles 2x zoom, using a crop from the full sensor for optical-quality results. The Pixel 8 grabbed a few small tweaks, but the Pixel 8 Pro now has a truly pro-grade setup. While the Pixel 8 picked up a few nice camera updates, the real power lies in Google's Pixel 8 Pro. It has a similar 50MP primary sensor to its more affordable counterpart, offering an identical maximum aperture for low-light performance. However, the Pixel 8 Pro's sensor supports multi-zone LDAF instead of single-zone for quicker focusing. The Pro-grade Pixel also offers an upgraded ultrawide sensor, ditching the 12MP resolution. Google's high-resolution 48MP ultrawide sensor bumps to a wider f/2.0 aperture for better low-light results. It also quad-bins ultrawide images to 12MP by default. Of course, the Pixel 8 Pro's camera bump has space for a third sensor â€” the 48MP telephoto. It's similar to the previous Pixel 7 Pro's telephoto lens in terms of resolution and default 5x optical zoom, but wider is the name of the game. Google shifted its Pixel 8 Pro from a 120mm equivalent sensor to 113mm and picked up a full stop of aperture brightness. The Pixel 8 Pro jumped from a maximum aperture of f/3.5 to f/2.8, lending extra punch to low-light results and offering a shallower depth of field for portrait shots. Despite its changes, the Pixel 8 Pro still tops out at 30x Super Res Zoom. The last camera hardware tweak on the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro lies in the selfie camera. Both phones now sport identical 10.5MP punch hole sensors at the top of the display, a slight drop from the previous 10.8MP option. Google's updated selfie shooter offers a slightly wider field of view, too, bumping from a 21mm equivalent to an even 20mm. Now, on to the fun stuff â€” the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro camera software. Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro camera: Software features Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Alright, now that the hardware is out of the way, let's get to the real star of the Pixel 8 camera â€” the software. It's why many of us picked up a Pixel device in the first place, with some on our team still fondly remembering the powerful Pixel 3 series. Now, the Tensor G3 is enough proof that the Pixel can always learn some new tricks. Google's first new trick is a Pixel 8 Pro exclusive. For the first time on a Pixel device, you can take manual control over your images. After years of tapping the shutter button and trusting the phone to do the rest, the Google Pixel 8 Pro lets you manage granular tweaks like the shutter speed and ISO. The change comes with a slightly modified layout in the Pixel Camera app â€” one that's proving slightly divisive for Rita, our resident Pixel camera expert â€” but beggars can't be choosers. All of the Pixel 8 Pro's camera controls lie in the bottom right corner of the app, hidden inside a small menu of sliders. As for shooting modes, the Pixel 8 series supports everything the Pixel 7 did â€” and then some. Mainstays like Motion Mode, Cinematic Pan, Panorama, and Night Sight are back, but the base Pixel 8 finally supports Macro Focus through its ultrawide camera. Other new shooting options on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro include astrophotography and improved Ultra HDR support. Google's Tensor G3 is the powerhouse behind brand-new features like Magic Editor, Video Boost, and more. Of course, the real upgrades come after you've pressed the shutter button, and they rely on a bit of help from the Tensor G3. Google introduced several new editing tricks with the Pixel 8 series, including the surprisingly controversial Best Take. It essentially lets you swap individual faces in a group shot to create a version where everyone is smiling. There are limits to Best Take â€” you have to take several photos in quick succession and it seems limited to around eight faces â€” but it works quickly and seamlessly in the right conditions. The Pixel 8 series also introduces the next steps in Google's Magic Eraser: Audio Magic Eraser and Magic Editor . You can still erase people and objects from photos or camouflage them away, but now the Pixel 8 series will help you to separate background noise from your subject in a video. The effect is similar to recording audio on a separate microphone and isolating it from a noisy city street. Magic Editor, on the other hand, is a step toward hosting Photoshop inside of Google Photos. It lets you replace the sky in certain scenes, or you can even erase entire crowds of people and use generative fill to replace them, like in the samples below. Original Magic Editor - Golden Hour Magic Editor - Eraser The results areâ€¦ not perfect yet, but it's no less impressive to see Google push the Tensor G3 this far. Magic Editor also lets you pick out individuals in your shot and move them around or resize them within the image. It should then adjust the lighting and exposure on the subject you move â€” something often easier said than done. In true Google fashion, some of the Pixel 8's best camera tricks are still yet to come. Part of promising seven years of updates for the Pixel 8 series means that Google can perfect certain features before rolling them out. In this case, that means waiting until the end of 2023 to launch Video Boost. Video Boost is another Pixel 8 Pro exclusive feature, and it's designed to process your videos frame-by-frame to boost them in the same way that the Tensor G3 boosts photos. It's not quite as fast as the Tensor G3, though â€” Video Boost requires the Pixel 8 Pro to",positive,,EN,,,"2,27",BOTSWANA,7233,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-pixel-8-pro-vs-pixel-8-cameras.jpg,9430400,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2829120,0,0,P01,,,P

We test the Google Pixel 8 series battery life and charging times to determine if these handsets will take you through a day of use or more. Android phones Google Pixel 8 series battery life and charging speeds: What you need to know Can Google shake past demons and produce two new phones that'll easily last a day and charge quickly when you need them to? By â€¢ November 6, 2023 Google's Pixel series hasn't always convinced us in terms of battery life and charging times, but we're cautiously optimistic that things have changed for the better with the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro . We've tested the battery life and charging performance of the two latest Pixel phones, and both have made solid progress toward being some of the best phones for battery life . Here's everything you need to know. Pixel 8 series battery and charging specs Google Pixel 8 27W wired charging, USB-PD 3.0 PPS Google Pixel 8 Pro 30W wired charging, USB-PD 3.0 PPS Wired charging times 18W wireless charging, Pixel Stand 2nd Gen 12W wireless charging, Qi 23W wireless charging, Pixel Stand 2nd Gen 12W wireless charging, Qi Not included in-box, sold separately Google Pixel 8 Pro Not included in-box, sold separately Pixel 8 series battery life: What to expect? Rita El Khoury / Android Authority With a large 4,575mAh battery in the regular Pixel 8 and 5,050mAh cell in the Pixel 8 Pro, the specs alone suggest solid battery life. The Pixel 8 has a 220mAh larger battery than its predecessor, after all. This bears out in our Pixel 8 Pro review , where we noted that the phone often made it to the end of the day with 25% or so capacity to spare on most days and 10% left with heavier use. These certainly aren't two-day phones, but a day should be comfortable for most. Google's Tensor G3 chipset is partly to thank here. Targeting a slightly more conservative footprint than other chipsets and the move to a slightly more efficient manufacturing process helps phones last through most of our daily use cases without sapping the battery. However, we're a little concerned that the chipset might chug down more juice when pushed to extremes. We ran the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro through our battery life tests with mixed results. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro perform well in our web browsing and Wi-Fi video streaming tests, outscoring last year's 7 Pro by roughly an hour in each test. The lower resolution display and slightly lower performance point seem to help the smaller battery of the Pixel 8 perform slightly better than it's bigger brother. Note that these are exclusive app tests, meaning mixed workloads will drain the battery faster. Still, the results confirm our hands-on experience that these phones can easily make it through an entire day of the most common mobile workloads. Good job Google. Our extreme gaming battery test is less convincing, suggesting around just three hours of play time for the most demanding games for both models. That's notably worse than the Pixel 7 Pro, which scored closer to four hours. More so, the mid-tier performance point of the Tensor G3's GPU should be more power efficient than a bleeding-edge rival, but we've seen more powerful phones score similarly and post much higher frame rates. The good news is that most games aren't as demanding as our test, so the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro should offer at least three hours of gaming without a charge, which should still be ample for all but the most devoted mobile gamers. Does the Pixel 8 series charge faster than the Pixel 7? If you do manage to drain the battery down within the day, the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro sport higher charging power levels this year, at 27W and 30W, respectively, according to Google. As our in-depth Pixel 8 charging tests found, the new models' higher power levels translate into meaningfully faster charging times. Google has shaved roughly 20 minutes off the full charge time for both the Pixel 8 and the Pixel 8 Pro when using an optimal 30W USB PD PPS charger. The former takes about 77 minutes to full, while we clocked the Pro to finish charging in around 79 minutes. The Pixel 8 is also notably faster to key milestones than the Pixel 7, hitting 25% battery in 12 minutes, 50% in 27 minutes, and 75% in 44 minutes compared to 15, 30, and 52 minutes for the old model. The Pixel 8 Pro is also marginally faster to these points, but its most significant benefits over the 7 Pro are seen when the battery is above 60%. The key to Google's faster charging isn't just in the higher power levels, though those are key. The Pixel 8 series, and the regular model in particular, are much better at sustaining these peak power levels, enabling faster charging for longer. Importantly, this has all been accomplished while still keeping temperatures within a reasonable range. The Pixel 8 series still might not be the fastest to charge, but they're much improved over last-gen. Wireless charging specifications remain unchanged from last year, resulting in similar charging times. The regular Pixel 8 supports wireless charging at 18W with a Pixel Stand 2nd Gen and 12W with Qi-certified chargers. The Pixel 8 Pro also supports 12W Qi and up to 21W power levels on the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen. Pixel 8 battery tech vs the competition Robert Triggs / Android Authority Overall, the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are improved over their predecessors both in terms of battery life and charging capabilities. They'll both last a bit longer than last year's models in most scenarios and can charge up quicker than before on occasions where you can't quite make it through a full day. However, the Pixel 8 series isn't going to win any awards here. Battery life on both models remains marginally on the better side of average rather than exceptional. Power users or those looking for a couple of days of lighter use on a single charge will be better served by the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra or Apple's gargantuan iPhone 15 Pro Max . Pixel 8 charging times are still a long way behind the best in the business as well. That title belongs to the latest flagships from OPPO, OnePlus, and Xiaomi, which boast huge levels of charging power to top their phones up to full in around 30 minutes. That said, the Pixel 8 series remains cooler while charging, which should help keep the need for a battery replacement to a minimum.

1221919764,WWW.ANDROIDPOLICE.COM,11/8/2023,NEWS,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-8-pro-vs-pixel-fold/,Google Pixel 8 Pro vs. Pixel Fold: Top-of-the-line slab or sleek foldable?,"Google Pixel 8 Pro vs. Pixel Fold: Top-of-the-line slab or sleek foldable? The Pixel Fold is facing stiff competition from its own brand The Pixel Fold is facing stiff competition from its own brand Bluetooth 5.2 Design The obvious difference between the two devices is the foldable screen on the Pixel Fold, but the design is more interesting than just two Pixel phones stuck together. The camera bar on the rear of the Pixel Fold doesn't reach the edges of the phone and is less prominent overall than the Pixel 8 Pro's camera bar, which merges seamlessly into the phone's sides. The Pixel 8 Pro emphasizes the minimalistic design by uniting its camera lenses into one rounded rectangle. The Pixel 8 Pro's camera bar and frame are polished aluminum, while the Pixel Fold's is polished steel. Both phones' rear is matte glass, a blessed improvement over the slippery gloss on the Pixel 7 series. However, all these design choices are insignificant compared to each phone's size. When folded, the Pixel Fold measures 139.7 x 79.5 x 12.1mm, compared to 162.6 Ã— 76.5 Ã— 8.8mm on the Pixel 8 Pro. The height difference might seem like a negative point for the Pixel Fold, but the resultant 17.4:9 aspect ratio is much more comfortable to look at and hold. Displays The Pixel 8 Pro has a considerably higher peak brightness of 2,000 nits than the Pixel Fold's 1,550 nits on its exterior screen. The Pixel 8 Pro's Super Actua Display also utilizes LTPO OLED technology, which responds more quickly and demands less power than the Pixel Fold's OLED screen. These improvements aren't the most groundbreaking changes of the Pixel 8 Fold, but the difference is noticeable in bright sunlight. Unfortunately, the Pixel Fold's inner screen doesn't hold up as well. The Pixel Fold's inner screen has to, well, fold, meaning Google couldn't just duplicate the external screen on a bigger scale. With a measly 1,000 nits of brightness in High Brightness Mode, a wide crease, an overly reflective screen that shows off every smudge and scratch on the pre-installed screen protector, and a cheap-feeling touch, the Pixel 8 Pro beats it comfortably in every aspect. Performance and battery life The Pixel 8 Pro offers 12GB RAM, a 5,050mAh battery, and 30W fast wired charging. The Pixel Fold has a slightly smaller 4821mAh battery but has identical charging speeds and RAM. While the numbers suggest similar battery life, the power-hungry screen on the Pixel Fold means it'll run out slightly faster than the 8 Pro. Where each phone's internal hardware differs the most is the Tensor chip generation. The Pixel 8 Pro houses the latest Tensor G3 chipset, but don't expect significant performance improvements. The Tensor G3 chip has improved machine learning and AI capability, which, while capable of some impressive feats , don't substantially impact performance. The AI features on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are miles ahead of what the Pixel Fold is capable of, but you'll struggle to notice a difference when it comes to gaming. However, it's ironic that the photo editing features exclusive to the Pixel 8 Pro would be easier to use on the Pixel Fold. Software The Pixel 8 Pro launched with Android 14 out of the box, and this version of the OS is also available on the Pixel Fold. This means both phones have access to the same bells and whistles accompanying Android 14 , but the Pixel Fold has a few more tricks up its sleeve. Google prepared for the launch of the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet by redesigning most of its first-party apps to suit larger screens. However, third-party apps don't offer a consistent experience, meaning you'll have to constantly rotate the phone so apps fill up the whole screen. Opening two apps simultaneously (one on each half of the screen) is an immediate solution, but closing and reopening the phone will only reopen one app. The result is an inconsistent and frustrating software experience compared to the Pixel 8 Pro's tried-and-tested single-screen approach to Android. However, the redesigned apps for the Pixel Fold are undeniably stunning. Regarding software support, the Pixel 8 Pro is a clear winner. Google promises seven years of software and security updates for the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, until October 2030. In contrast, the Pixel Fold will receive its last software update on June 2026 and security update on June 2028. Cameras Anyone remotely familiar with the Pixel lineup in recent years will know that the Pro models boast phenomenal cameras, and this is no different in the Pixel 8 Pro, which boasts a 50MP primary sensor and 48MP ultrawide and telephoto cameras. Combined with the Pixel Pro's range of camera tricks , you've got a smartphone camera that's in the best of its class. However, not all of us need the latest and greatest camera, and the Pixel Fold's rear camera isn't a slouch. The Pixel Fold's 48MP primary camera takes excellent photos, partly thanks to the post-processing features inherent in Pixel phones. While it doesn't match the Pixel 8 Pro's phenomenal lenses, the Pixel Fold is more than enough for everyday photography. The Pixel Fold does, however, beat the Pixel 8 Pro for selfies. Open the Pixel Fold, and you can use the rear cameras for selfies, with the external screen as a viewfinder. This means you won't need to rely on the front-facing camera, and you have a whole screen to help perfect your shot. Which is right for you? It's sad to say, but the Pixel Fold already looks outdated compared to the Pixel 8 Pro. While it was hard to choose between last year's Pixel 7 Pro and the Pixel Fold , the Pixel 8 Pro is better on paper than the Pixel Fold in every way. The biggest choice you have to make is considering whether the Pixel experience on foldables is worth the hardware downgrades and increased price. Source: Google The best Pixel to date It's hard not to be impressed with Google's latest flagship The Google Pixel 8 Pro might not break new ground (unless you count the temperature sensor), but its refined design and impressive slate of AI features make it a significant improvement over last year's model. It's the best Pixel device to date, even if it doesn't sport a fancy foldable design. $999 at Amazon $999 at Google Store $999 at Best Buy The Pixel 8 Pro has refined the design established in the Pixel 6 Pro into a stunning powerhouse. However, the Pixel Fold is still an excellent device, and the versatility inherent in a foldable phone is undeniable. That said, if you're considering a foldable phone , Samsung has spent years refining its design. If you want the latest and greatest in mobile hardware, the Pixel 8 Pro is right for you. If you want a versatile Pixel experience, the Pixel Fold might be a better choice. Source: Google Runner up A flawed but impressive experience The Google Pixel Fold gets a lot of things right, but its many flaws make the $1,800 asking price seem a touch high.

This collection is a personal attempt to reconnect with my heritage and gain a stronger sense of belonging. EBLA is an appreciation of the elements and memories which I cherish from my childhood in Ecuador, as well as a celebration of my Latin culture which helps me feel closer to home. My grandmothers house in particular is a core part of my inspiration, which make up the details and components of this collection, it is a tribute to my grandmother and to her family name, EBLA.'

They explore the contrasting surface textures and material qualities of metal and glass. Their pieces are intended to create intrigue within the mind of the viewers, making them wonder how the collection was made and how the elements interlock and balance without falling. Since the work is made from glass there is an added perception of fragility, potentially causing the viewer to feel apprehensive, reflecting the question of the stability of the craft industry and how it may change in the future. The texture is applied to mimic the formation of rust, giving the glass an aged metallic appearance in places. This surface texture contrasts with the crisp geometric forms, showing that glass doesn't need to be stereotypically pretty to be eye-catching and beauty can be found in the combination of more formal mundane shapes and forms.

Gaming Technology The Google Pixel 8 Line-Up Balances Gaming, Photos & Software We dig into the brand new Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro devices, then check out 'Sonic Superstars' and the party-friendly 'Jackbox Party Pack 10'. | 08.11.2023 We dig into the brand new Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro devices, then check out Sonic Superstars and the party-friendly Jackbox Party Pack 10. When it comes to Android devices, Google's Pixel line-up has long been the top dog in my eyes thanks to its incredibly strong software suite and photographic chops. Now, after having spent some time with the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, it seems that the tech giant has another winner on its hands. The first thing you'll notice about the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro is the device's change-up in visual aesthetic. Gone, for example is the boxier shape in favour of much more rounded corners. Likewise, the screen now embraces a flat design, which will likely please the majority of users (especially when it comes to getting a proper fit with a screen protector), but I'll personally admit to being a fan of the older design which just made everything pop a little more. Flip things around and even the Pixel 7's glass back panel has been swapped out for a matte finish this time around, but it's surprising that such a small change has lead to so many benefits. The biggest boon is that the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are both just a whole lot easier to hold thanks to a surface that's nowhere near as slippery. On top of that though, the device as a whole becomes way less of a fingerprint magnet, which is a big deal if you're one of those loose cannons who uses their phone without a case. We were able to test out the Charcoal-like Obsidian colourway, and it's incredibly sleek to look at (even if you do throw on one of official cases) but Google is especially touting the Blue â€˜Bay' colourway which will does well to showcase a large pop of colour, but unfortunately is only available for the Pro model. But forget about how the Pixel 8 looks, because this new kid on the block also makes some decent strides on the gaming front as well. From rounds of Call of Duty mobile to continuing my obsession with Marvel Snap, both Pixel devices handled my demands capably, although you'll likely want to gravitate towards the Pro thanks to its 12GB of ram (verses the base model's 8) and higher peak brightness that helps it shine both indoors and outdoors. Call of Duty mobile could run at some of its highest settings without sacrificing framerates, however you should be warned that the phone will run a little warm if you do that. Love Gaming? Get the latest Gaming news, features, updates and giveaways straight to your inbox Learn more JOIN Even with Google's Tensor G3 behind it though, the 8 Pro isn't able to quite outshine the iPhone 15 Pro just yet, however the biggest impediment to gaming on the Pixel 8 line-up is perhaps the Android platform itself, which simply isn't as robust as Apple's offering. Where the iPhone 15 Pro is touting its ability to capably handle the likes of Resident Evil Village, the Pixel just isn't able to match those high-end offerings. But boot up your Netflix subscription, though, and you'll still have plenty to sink your teeth into. Where the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro does excel as always though is with its camera suite and that's no different here. The now infamous Pixel camera visor houses a 50 MP Octa PD wide camera and 12 MP ultrawide for the 8, while the Pro swaps out the latter for a 48 MP Quad PD ultrawide and 48 MP Quad PD telephoto camera. Naturally that means the 8 Pro is capable of pumping out much sharper, more detailed images, but rest assured if you're a casual user you'll likely be thoroughly impressed with the results all the same, especially with improvements to evening shots. But while I've always been a fan of the Pixel's photographic output, it's the software updates under the shell that help the whole process shine. Best Take is the prime example of that: allowing you to retrospectively craft the optimal group photo but combing various faces from different takes into one single photo. If you have a father who has a penchant for closing his eyes at the worst time, or a sibling who can't help but occasionally look away, it's a bloody great feature that hits way more than it misses. All in all, the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are both incredibly appealing devices, especially when you factor Google's beefy promise of 7 years of updates. This jump is a huge boon for Pixel users and means you should be able to confidently keep using the device into the next decade should you be so inclined. Throw in extra features like Audio Magic Eraser, Live Translate and a temperature sensor and there's a hell of a lot to take advantage of here. Starting at $1,199 for the Pixel 8 and $1,699 for the Pixel Pro, Google continues to deliver a quality device that is markedly cheaper than some of its biggest competitors. If you're in the market for a new Android device that balances software, gaming and stellar photos, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal. You can pick up a Google Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro from the Google Store here . Also out nowâ€¦ Sonic Superstars (PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, XBO, PC) After years of disappointments, it seems Sonic fans have a lot to cheer about of late, and Sonic Superstars does well to continue that momentum. The levels harken back to the classic momentum-focused gameplay that cemented the blue blur's popularity, even if that does occasionally mean you'll have to fail a few times before eventually striking upon the perfect path to follow. Still, I appreciated much of the 2D design and the bright visual palate that will bring a smile to your face. Playing solo, there's a hell of a lot to love with Sonic Superstars nostalgic-inspired adventure. Testing out the new co-op mode, on the other hand, and thing are less successful. Due to the sheer speedy nature that Sonic and friends possess, it means that you and your friends will likely zip around all over levels, forcing all sorts of proximity-based respawns that will quickly irritate. I'm optimistic the idea can work in the future, but it's going to take a bit of refinement to get there. Don't let that dissuade you though. Sonic fans will still get plenty out of Superstars, and at least as a solitary experience, it's worth checking out. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 (PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, XBO, PC) I'll come out and say it: the original Hot Wheels Unleashed does not get nearly as much recognition as it deserves. The 2021 arcade racer was fast, furious, chaotic and whole lot of fun. Thankfully, a couple of years later we have the follow up, and while Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged may not completely reinvent the wheel, it will certainly reignite your need for speed. Yes, there's a brand new campaign to tuck into, drawing on the series' classic history, but more interesting is the switch-up in the game's actual mechanics. That's because Turbocharged introduces a double-jump and dash to the mix, and both do a great job at expanding the flexibility present within racers. The dash for, example, can be used as an offensive manuover by side-swiping unsuspecting foes, or taking more passively to quickly jut off the beaten path to make use of a potential shortcut. Throw a smorgasbord of new vehicles, the return of multiplayer and that same charm that made its predecessor a surprise gem and Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is yet another shiny new toy worth ripping out of its packaging.

Google Pixel 8 Pro â€“ Although convincing in the test, it is not a smartphone for everyone Google Pixel 8 Pro (photo: Daniel Schmidt) Many years of updates, a bright OLED display, a thick battery, stereo speakers, an extensive camera setup, and much more: this is the Pixel 8 Pro. But behind many of the great features also hide some details that could be dealbreakers for some. Daniel Schmidt, ðŸ‘ Daniel Schmidt ( translated by Mark Riege), Published 11/10/2023 4 Reviews In the test, the Google Pixel 8 Pro impresses with its well-rounded overall concept. The 6.7-inch LTPO-OLED display offers a high pixel density, a refresh rate between 1 and 120 Hz, and a very high brightness. Unfortunately, it also showed itself in the test as not particularly easy on the eyes for some sensitive users, since it doesn't include high-frequency PWM dimming, but the frequencies we measured are fairly low. It comes with the brand-new Android 14 with seven years of guaranteed updates, so that even Android 21 will still be installed on the Google smartphone. Although the inhouse Tensor G3 processor is fast, we encounter the second but here, since the Google SoC is significantly slower than the processors used by the competitors, even if those don't include the models with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 yet. Many of the AI functions are also outsourced to the cloud, even some of those that other manufacturers run directly on the smartphone. Another highlight are the cameras, and even the quality of the additional lenses is at a high level. You really get a high-quality overall camera package here, starting from macro recordings up to a powerful zoom. A minor downside: Even though the image stabilization is very good at longer focus lengths, it then limps behind the Live View. And when recording videos, there could have been more options in the frame rates. There is no 21:9 mode at all. The Pixel 8 Pro uses USB 3.2, but it is only the slower version with a maximum of 5 Gbit/s, which doesn't turn out particularly fast for this kind of connection in our copy test. The Google smartphone also doesn't offer wired display output. The Google Pixel 8 Pro is worth a recommendation for sure. But those who belong to the group of users that is sensitive to display flickering should better choose a model that uses high-frequency PWM dimming, such as the Honor Magic5 Pro . For those who value video functionalities, there is hardly any way around the iPhone 15 Pro (Max) . You can get the Pixel 8 Pro for example from Amazon .

The appeal of Google's Pixel series has always been software, right from its roots as a showcase of pure Android the way Google intendedâ€¦to bringing in the latest AI-photography innovations to market. And so it is with the Pixel 8 Pro, a phone that had me go wow each time I tested one of its several new software features. Yet, is it enough to warrant the princely price tag of over INR 1 lakh? Also read: Meta to sell cheaper VR headset in China: Report Unless you're holding the new â€˜Bay' colour variant with the light blue, matte finish rear, it's not easy to tell the Pixel 8 Pro apart from its predecessor. You still get the visually distinct aluminium visor housing a triple camera system, and there's a new temperature sensor under the flash. Corners are more rounded, for a better, almost-pebble-like hand feel. Flip it around, and the changes are more visible â€“ a flat-edged 6.7-inch OLED â€˜Super Actua' display with increased 2,400 nits brightness, and the rather excellent LTPO (1-120Hz) display is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2, as is the rear panel. Stereo speakers, good haptics, wireless charging and IP68 dust-water resistance round out the premium build and design. One hopes the Pixel 8 Pro lasts seven years â€“ that's the staggering level of software support for this device, taking it all the way from Android 14 till Android 21! Now, Pixels have always been camera first handsets, and there's a new set of sensors â€“ a 50 MP primary, a 48 MP 5x telephoto and a 48 MP ultrawide, all of which enjoy improvements to low-light sensitivity. Pictures in daylight are excellent, with good details and somewhat warmer colors, but details really shine in dimly lit conditions, even when handheld. The 5x telephoto does a great job in punching into a scene and taking you closer to the subject without sacrificing image quality. The new Pro mode allows for greater creative control, and macros using the upgraded ultrawide are pleasing as well. The Pixel 8 Pro takes brilliant pictures Once you've shot an image, Google unleashes a bevy of AI-powered editing tools that I assure you will make you question what's real in every photo you see coming from a Pixel. Take the upgraded Magic Eraser tool, that uses on-device generative AI to remove large objects and people from a photo and generate new pixels in their place. Spoiler alert: it works shockingly well, removing people even from the foreground and filling in greenery and fences behind them, as if they never existed! Or Best Take, which analyzes a series of similar group shots to reconstruct, if you will, an image where everyone is looking at the camera and smiling! Yet, it's the Magic Editor tool that shows you the true potential of AI-editing â€“ it uses off-device AI to completely manipulate an image by moving objects or people in a photo, change the background etc. It's also easy to tell these are early days for this tech â€“ these tools take frustratingly long to run on most images, and I'm hoping Google picks the pace up over time, else these will remain novelty AI features that folks just won't have the patience to use. Also read: Sam Altman takes a jibe at Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, users react Some of it comes down to Google's Tensor G3 chipset that powers the 8 Pro which, while it runs cooler than last year's Tensor G2, also tends to throttle performance during extended gaming sessions and tends to fall behind 2022's flagship in terms of pure performance. Battery life is good for a day of moderate usage, with moderately faster-yet-still-slow 30 W charging speeds. Google now retails a 12 GB memory/256 GB storage variant, which is a step up from the sole (and paltry) 128 GB model at launch, but you're going to have to really want the AI and camera tricks to justify spending upwards of a lakh on this, particularly if you consider the significant jump the price represents over the Pixel 7 Pro.

Read More. If you know anything about me, you know I'm a big fan of Samsung's smartphones. In fact, next March will mark the fifth anniversary of my move to Galaxy devices . I'd spent most of the 2010s using Nexus and Pixel devices, but on the heels of the Pixel 3, it was time for a change. While I've kept Google's hardware around primarily to test out upcoming Android releases, I've never felt the temptation to return â€” that is, until I laid eyes on the Pixel 8 . I've been using a Pixel 8 Pro for two weeks now, and after spending this much time with it, I need to decide if I'm swapping sides to Team Pixel. The Galaxy S23 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro both have a lot going for them, but only one can win my heart. Display: Brighter isn't always better Close The display on the Pixel 8 Pro is gorgeous. My S23 Ultra never struggled in sunlight with its 1,750 nits, but the 2,400 nits available to the Pixel sets it apart. While I don't mind curved displays, the flat screen on the 8 Pro is a welcome change, especially as Google kept the sides of the glass slightly curved for more comfortable gestures. I also appreciate the rounded corners, which are more comfortable to hold, even if they lead to some awkward spacing in the status bar. The Pixel 8 Pro's screen would be the obvious winner if it weren't for two complaints: a less reliable optical fingerprint scanner and no stylus support. Samsung's ultrasonic fingerprint scanner got off to a rough start when the Galaxy S10 launched, but the sluggishness has been absent since the S21 Ultra improved the scanner hardware. The optical unit in the Pixel isn't bad, but it has a higher failure rate and is almost guaranteed not to work if my fingers are wet. The S23 Ultra unlocks fast all day, every day. As for stylus support, this is something few people care about. I do care, though, because I use my phone to keep several pain/migraine/medication diaries up to date, and the stylus makes it a breeze. Both phones also support face unlock in addition to their respective fingerprint scanners, using the front-facing cameras rather than any special sensors. Google's implementation, however, is secure enough on the Pixel 8 to be used with banking apps and password managers. Still, it isn't perfect. It barely works at night, and my sunglasses often confuse it. Samsung's version, while less secure, maxes screen brightness to illuminate your face at night and unlock your phone, and you can train a second face model with your sunglasses on. I also found the Pixel's auto brightness settings aren't reliable. It takes ages to react to a change in light, and when it does, I almost always have to adjust it manually anyway. Samsung devices are far quicker to react, and far more accurate when adjusting to my surrounding conditions. Software: Smart features or infinite customization? Close Google's Pixel UI and Samsung's One UI both look great visually, but I have my fair share of complaints about both. The notification shade and quick settings panel is a definite win for Samsung. I dislike wasted space, and limiting a display as large as the Pixel 8 Pro's to two columns of giant quick settings toggles is something I still dislike after two weeks of use. I also hate the positioning of the brightness slider. For starters, One UI lets you add the brightness slider to the notification shade for easier access, and it's in a more accessible position to reach. Both of these phones are massive, and reaching up to the very top to adjust brightness is painful. Close Frankly, there are a lot of features in One UI that I wish the Pixel had, but I'll narrow them down to just four. Good Lock is something I've spent a lot of time writing about, and with good reason. Three of the four items we'll discuss here are part of Samsung's optional Good Lock suite, in fact, proving just how essential it's become to any power user with a Samsung device. QuickStar lets you modify your notification shade and quick settings. I mainly use this for hiding status bar indicators so that everything looks cleaner. I always have a smartwatch connected, and my phone is always on mute, so why do I need to stare at a Bluetooth and mute icon all the time? Annoyingly, this used to be possible on Google's phones back in the Marshmallow days, but Google removed these options a few years later. Good Lock also lets you apply icon packs from the Play Store system-wide. It's a small bit of customization, admittedly, but one I value nonetheless. You can also mess with Android's gesture navigation, which I miss every time I swipe to go back on the Pixel. I have things configured so that a short swipe takes me back, a short swipe diagonally up opens recent apps, and diagonally down triggers the home button. If I swipe out and hold, I can access quick tools, a widget panel, or one-handed mode. Finally, we have modes and routines. These are as well-integrated in One UI as Siri Shortcuts are in iOS, and there isn't anything close to an alternative on the Pixel 8 Pro. With the touch of a button, I can make my phone mute itself, enable dark mode, and activate the blue light filter if I get a migraine. When I go swimming, my GPS location will put the phone in do not disturb and change the face on my Galaxy Watch 6 to something more exercise-orientated. Close It goes both ways, though. Call Screening is something all Pixel users love, and now that I've used it, I don't want to go back. When I last used a Pixel as my daily driver, this feature was exclusive to the US and Canada, but that isn't the case anymore. Screening calls, navigating menus, and sitting on hold on my behalf is something I use constantly. Meanwhile, Now Playing was one of my favorite parts of the Pixel experience in the past, and it's no different in 2023. Its ability to identify songs accurately, even in noisy environments, is nothing short of impressive. While I've only listed two Pixel features here, they point out a critical difference between the software experience on both phones . The S23 Ultra has a feature for almost everything, and they're nice to have. The Pixel, on the other hand, has fewer features that feel more important. They're nice to have, yes, but more than that, they feel like things I wouldn't want to ever lose, even for a brief amount of time. Battery life and performance: Smooth or dependable? Samsung made my year when they released the Galaxy S23 series with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 worldwide instead of limiting the UK and other regions to inferior Exynos chips. My personal Galaxy S22 Ultra was a disaster because of the Exynos 2200, which never offered consistent performance and always got far too hot for daily use. I expected the Pixel to be closer to the Exynos than the Snapdragon in that area. Thankfully, Tensor G3 is much improved over its predecessor â€” although it isn't perfect, my Pixel 8 Pro has never had a problem with raw performance or smoothness. Benchmarks are meaningless these days; the experience of using a device is what matters. The Pixel 8 Pro is the smoothest phone I've ever used, even more so than my S23 Ultra, though it lacks Samsung's level of consistency. My Pixel has stayed cool most of the time, but there have been several occasions where it'll heat up despite the fact it isn't under load. I spent an hour hammering the camera system while streaming music over 5G, and it stayed cool to the touch. The next day, while waiting for a haircut and listening to a podcast over Wi-Fi, it got red-hot. Tensor G3 does stay cooler than Tensor G2, but it still has seemingly random blips. My S23 Ultra has only gotten warm once. It was the day I got it, which meant it was under particularly rough conditions: 45W fast-charging, signing into various accounts, downloadin",positive,,EN,,,"2,81",ITALY,4408,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/s23-ultra-pixel-8-pro-3-1.JPG,2694704,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,808411,0,0,N00,,,P

To officially kick start the campaign, it was decided that it would be launched in Windsor.* Good evening, and thank you for being here as the Pirate Party starts our campaign for the Southwestern Ontario by-election. This certainly isn't the first campaign I've run and I imagine it won't be the last - however it is the first in Southwestern Ontario. I'm here to discuss why I should be the next Member of Parliament for you and our great communities, and why the voters can put their faith in the Pirate Party, voting for us in this by-election with the knowledge that we will truly represent you and the matters important to you as your elected representatives in Parliament. We're transparent about our priorities, and the things that we would deliver for you in Parliament - there can be no mistake about that fact. As your Member of Parliament I will work alongside /u/model-avtron in delivering the policies that we continue to talk about and champion on your behalf. Let's begin with the Direct Democracy Bill, a truly transformative vision that will empower the people of Southwestern Ontario, and change our democratic processes for the better. By introducing a system that allows the people to call referendums on the issues that are important to them, the people of Southwestern Ontario will have power put back into their hands and force politicians to listen to their constituents. We've pledged to reintroduce such legislation to Parliament and fight for accountability. This is something I'm clear about supporting as a candidate, and will be proactive in supporting as your Member of Parliament. Housing is something that I will touch upon throughout my campaign too. We were clear in the federal election and we are clear again in this by-election - housing is a human right, and so too is access to a community that delivers for everybody. There is action the Government can take to deliver for housing and our communities, and it's the Pirate Party that is prepared to talk about it in this by-election campaign. We would set legal targets for housebuilding, especially social housing which provides for working people, and we would champion a crown owned building company which would allow us to build houses in communities across Southwestern Ontario, and across Canada as a whole. And yes, we should be talking about Climate Change in this campaign as well. It's clear to us both in Canada, and on the international stage, that the time for talking is gone - and the time for acting against climate change and the devastating consequences it can bring began a long time ago. Climate Change is having an impact in Ontario, in Canada, and across the world. We should be looking at policies which will leave a better world for future generations, and protect our environment from further damage. The Pirates are clear that a 2050 target for Net Zero isn't good enough - and we would push for a more ambitious date of 2040 for reaching Net Zero, as well as ensuring we can fund and implement the policies that would help achieve this for our future generation and save our environment. There is much more that will be discussed throughout this campaign to be the next Member of Parliament for Southwestern Ontario - there is indeed a crowded field of candidates who would like to receive your vote. However, it's the Pirate Party that is dedicated to our local communities and will deliver the change of the future - you can send that message by voting for me, PoliticoBailey, as your next Member of Parliament. â€‹ [Social media videos are shared celebrating the speech PoliticoBailey gave to launch his campaign.](https://reddit.com/link/17vhgp0/video/5sozqimote0c1/player)",positive,,EN,,,"6,5",UNKNOWN,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,,140,r/ElectionsCMHoC,PoliticoBailey,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,42,0,0,P00,,,P

So, basically I never worked with Laravel before but I've been watching a few tutorials and I see how awesome it is. I have a SAAS project, currently live with 5-6k active monthly users that needs refactoring (it has a few architecture issues that is making it harder to maintain). So the idea is that I'll be migrating this project, built with pure PHP, into Laravel project. This project is going to server as an API only, the frontend is built in Angular and will consume all the data via API calls with JSON responses. So far so good, I saw a couple of online tutorials and I'm getting familiar with the basics. What is making it harder for me to understand, or at least plan the next step, is the structure. My current project is all organized in modules, where the controllers, models, services, repositories etc.. for each module is placed within the module folder. All the tutorials I've seen organize the file per type, so all models within Model folder, services within Service folder, etc... See the screenshots I attached. [\#Current structure](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1174147023612686486/1174147023751090207/image.png?ex=656688a1&is=655413a1&hm=9333c106bc59ad77bb7a7bd9a52592779aef6885f73ae758a83428718d3fe279&=) [\#Laravel proposal](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1174147023612686486/1174147023981772910/image.png?ex=656688a1&is=655413a1&hm=f794ea25b3ed77d9cd6bcb09eb41ca739ed36ea6435c07f6b1858ab8c384163e&=) So the application is split into 3 main areas. Portal (admins), User (regular users) and App (common to both). Each area has around 9-10 modules and it's increasing as the application grows. I also have thrid party libraries integrated, such as PostMark for transactional emails, Payment, WhatsApp messages, etc.. As well as other services built for the application, such as File Uploader, PDF reports, Email Service (to build the email body structure for different modules). So, I'd like to get your opinion on the subject as I have zero experience with laravel and, since I'll be refactoring the application, I'd rather do it the proper way now than doing something completely wrong, or that's going to make it harder to maintain.

Advertisement The Baywatch star, 56 - who recently revealed that ditching makeup was 'very freeing' - held a cheerful smile on her face as she sat inside the front room of The Roadhouse located on the Ladysmith property. In the caption, the model penned to her 3 million fans, 'I am most at home â€” with my animals, on the ocean with a light softness thrown aboutâ€¦ reading, writing and dreamingâ€¦' The actress could be seen wearing a flowy, white sundress that was held up with thick straps that wrapped around her shoulders. She sat on top of a circular stool with her knees drawn up to her chest as she paused for a spontaneous photo session. A post shared by Pamela Anderson (@pamelaanderson) Her blonde locks were parted in the middle, and effortlessly cascaded down naturally past her shoulders. Pamela sat at a rectangular-shaped, white island that had two stools placed in front. The walls, as well as the ceiling and exposed beams were all painted an off-white color to give a warm feeling to the space. Natural light streamed through the windows while the flooring was a mix of wood as well as black and white tile for a unique flare. Various pictures were enclosed in wooden frames and placed on the walls, offering a rustic feel. The Ladysmith property was initially purchased by her grandparents back in the 1950s, per the Vancouver Sun . A cabin is also located on the six-acres, where Anderson grew up. She told the outlet last year, 'I think I was really spoiled. When you grow up on the beach, you just expect it every morning. You expect these mornings.' The beauty later expressed, 'I just kind of sit around sometimes and go, How did I get here? What happened? I just left here, I went around the world and I came back slightly unscathed. I came back in one piece, which is a miracle.' Pamela continued, 'I always knew that I would come back here. I always knew if I had this place, I would keep a little bit of my sanity and a little bit of my feet on the ground.' Advertisement Happiness at home: In the caption, the model penned, 'I am most at home â€” with my animals, on the ocean with a light softness thrown aboutâ€¦ reading, writing and dreamingâ€¦'; seen in September in Paris The former Playboy model notably purchased the family property around 30 years earlier, but officially returned to the home in 2019, according to the publication. Along with The Roadhouse - which is the main residence - and The Cabin, the property also features both a vegetable and rose garden, a long pier as well as a lavish porch. The home has also been featured on the Hulu series titled, Pamela's Garden Of Eden. The premise follows the star 'as she leaves her Hollywood life behind, returns to her roots on the coast of Vancouver Island, and embarks on a massive restoration of her grandmother's legacy property,' per an official synopsis. The second season came to an end last month in October, and also saw the actress assisting her sons - Brandon, 27, and Dylan, 25 - renovate their newly-purchased home in sunny Los Angeles. Pamela notably shares her two children with ex-husband, Tommy Lee. While talking to Today earlier this month about the series, she stated, 'When I came home, I thought, I am going to rewrite my life and I'm going to start with this property. And it became like an art project. It really took my heart and soul.' Special series: The home has also been featured on the Hulu series titled, Pamela's Garden Of Eden; seen in April in Los Angeles Working together: The second season came to an end last month in October, and also saw the actress assisting her sons - Brandon, 27, and Dylan, 25 - renovate their newly-purchased home in L.A.; the trio seen in September in NYC However, the property didn't always hold fond memories for the actress, which prompted her to leave Ladysmith when she was 17. In her recent memoir titled Love, Pamela, she opened up about the abuse that she had suffered during her childhood. 'I think it takes a very courageous person to go back home,' Pamela explained. 'I don't know if you want to call it the scene of the crime, but I wanted to go back home and start from the beginning.' Anderson also told Today, 'I was really happy to spend this year just on my own with my dogs and my vegetables and the trees and the ocean.' However, she added, 'And as lonely as it's been at times, it's a good kind of lonely and it's something that also made me stronger.' A few months earlier, Pamela notably jumped into the spotlight when she attended Paris Fashion Week and opted for a natural, no makeup look. Advertisement Goodbye to makeup: A few months earlier, Pamela notably jumped into the spotlight when she attended Paris Fashion Week and opted for a natural, no makeup look; seen in September in Paris 'I'm makeup free at home, so why not for Paris Fashion Week?' she explained to People earlier this month. 'I really didn't know anyone would notice it, but I'm glad it became a positive message.' The beauty also commented on growing older and explained her viewpoint. 'I call it Life-ing, not aging.' 'Chasing youth is futile. All we can do is embrace who we are at the moment we are in, and be okay with where our feet stand right now.' Advertisement Pamela added, 'I don't have to be cool anymore. I can just be me. It's very freeing to be comfortable in your own skin.'

Attraverso questa foto, che ritrae un corpo in uno stato di palesata decadenza che a stento era in grado di sorreggersi su due gambe, mi rendo conto di come il dolore derivante dalla violenza che subivo quotidianamente nel mio paese d'origine stesse letteralmente consumando le mie risorse vitali, privandomi di ogni vigore. E mai, mai come in questo momento, mi sono resa conto che, rimanendo immersa in quel vortice di tenebra, non avrei resistito a lungo. Questa Ã¨ la violenza psicologica, d'altrocanto: un'entitÃ  incorporea, sfuggente, tangibile solo quando la si sente tra le costole che spingono implacabilmente verso l'abisso piÃ¹ profondo e insondabile del proprio essere. Laddove risiedono i nostri macigni, i nostri mostri imbavagliati, i demoni interiori che sembrano avere ogni risposta, le menzogne che ci raccontiamo nella vaga illusione che che la veritÃ  non le metta a tacere. I rimasugli del mio disturbo alimentare risvegliano talvolta una vaga nostalgia per quel corpo, tuttavia una parte di me, quella razionale, conscia dell'esistenza e sopravvissuta a quel frastuono interiore, non puÃ² che nutrire un profondo sentimento di gratitudine per ciÃ² che sono divenuta oggi. Sono grata alla vita per le opportunitÃ  concesse sinora e, prima di ogni altra cosa, per avermi concesso il privilegio di giungere sin dove sono, su questa vetta meravigliosa dalla quale ho potuto finalmente spiccare il volo. #love #libri #comerivestita #librichepassione #books #book #booklover #bookstagram #instabook #instalibri #scrivere #violenzadigenere #amoscrivere #libriconsigliati #revengeporn #disturbialimentari #anoressia #followforfollowback #likesforlike #likeforfollow #photooftheday #body #fashion #likexlike #instagood ",neutral,,IT,,,"6,5",ITALY,3,15,0,15,0,0,0,N,,https://extreme-img-rep.web-live.it/storage/2023/11/15/D2C4383F00848EC2F925CB50D9E209D65512FF7D6897EFE875BC30209889C6E1.jpg,0,ilariadiroberto_official,ilariadiroberto_official{49558610299},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,60,0,0,T00,,,P

It has been revealed during the Epic Games vs. Google court case that the tech titan wanted to pay a staggering sum to get Fortnite on the store. Â·1 min read Google Wanted to Pay Epic $147m For Fortnite On Play Store As we speak, Epic Games is embroiled in a tense court case against Google, having levelled accusations against the tech titan alleging that the firm tried â€˜acting as a monopoly', charging what is being reported as unreasonable commission on in-app purchases in the Google Play Store. In Google's defence, it was stated that it was remaining competitive with Apple and not working in a monopolistic fashion, but Epic is standing firm â€“ just as it did in 2021 against Apple. Big Bucks It has been revealed via the court case (and through The Verge ) that in 2018, Google was willing to offer Epic Games a whopping $147 million over three years in incremental funding. It was a no-go from Epic Games, despite Google having had the proposal approved internally â€“ all it needed was Epic's signature on the dotted line. Instead, Epic remained independent, offering Fortnite to Android users through a proprietary installer. In a backtrack movement, Epic Games did relent in 2020 and listed Fortnite on the Play Store â€“ against all wishes, it was stated. It was said that Google had made it â€˜exceedingly difficult' to avoid the Play Store, but barely four months later, the game was once again pulled from the Play Store, just days after it was stripped from the Apple Store. That was basically because Epic Games was, in a way, circumventing Google Play's transaction fees by offering in-app purchases. It's all dollars and cents discussions, of course. Now, in the court case of Epic Games vs. Google, it was revealed that the latter firm offered up almost $150 million for Epic to just list Fortnite on the Play Store. In a statement obtained by The Verge , Google tried to leverage some persuasive money-talk to convince Epic Games to get on board: Fortnite's absence could result in $130M (up to $250M) direct revenue loss with Play and that there could be a downstream impact of $550M (up to $3.6B) potential revenue loss if broad contagion to other developers. This course case is still ongoing.

We take a look at the results that moved the needle. How did Week 10 impact the projected 2024 NFL Draft order? We take a look at the results that moved the needle. A few thoughts on this week's projections: 1. Is Chicago 's double-up dream fading? Not that long ago, we were talking about the very real possibility that the Chicago Bears â€” thanks to that extra top-10 pick they'll hold via the Carolina Panthers â€” could walk out of Round 1 with the QB of its choosing (Caleb Williams or Drake Maye) and all-world Ohio State receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. Advertisement The Bears' Thursday night win over the Panthers did inch that Carolina draft slot closer to No. 1, but the Bears themselves now have three victories. Were the draft held today, their own pick would be No. 5. They'd still be in phenomenal shape to pair Williams/Maye (if that's the direction they go) with an elite prospect â€” Penn State OT Olu Fashanu, Georgia OT Amarius Mims and Georgia TE Brock Bowers were next up in Dane Brugler's recent top 50 . There'd be a different level of excitement, though, over pairing a potential franchise QB with Harrison, who could be one of the NFL's best receivers from the moment he arrives. Chicago now is projected to win 5.4 games this season, up from 4.9 a week ago. The upcoming schedule is daunting: two games with Detroit and trips to Minnesota and Cleveland. The final three weeks, however, could put wins on the board: Arizona, Atlanta, at Green Bay. What can Bears accomplish in final 7 games? QB, head coach, free-agent decisions loom 2. The Giants are (still) down bad By virtue of having played one fewer game, Carolina (1-8) still holds the top spot in the actual, current draft order. Mock's model, though, suggests that will flip by the slightest of margins when all is said and done â€” the New York Giants (2-8) fading all the way to that No. 1 pick. Even a three-win projection feels optimistic for coach Brian Daboll 's club at this point, although upcoming home games against New England and Green Bay appear winnable. The outcomes of those matchups will go a long way toward ultimately settling the draft's top 10. But the Giants haven't even been competitive the past two weeks (a 30-6 loss to Las Vegas and a 49-17 setback at Dallas). The 17 points New York scored Sunday marked its highest offensive output since Week 2. 3. Denver moves out of the top 10 After winning a game that both teams aggressively tried to lose Monday night in Buffalo, the Denver Broncos (4-5) are on a three-game heater and find themselves back in the very tightly packed AFC wild-card race. Their projections here aren't overly sunny â€” a win total of 7.6, a 6.9-percent playoff chance and a Hail Mary 0.3-percent shot at the division. Advertisement Those are slight bumps over last week, however (7.3 projected wins; 5.1-percent playoff chance), and they're good enough to nudge the Broncos out of the top 10 this week. Next up: A Sunday nighter against the surging Minnesota Vikings , in a game that's suddenly taken on a lot of meaning. How the Broncos pulled off a Monday night stunner in Buffalo: 'Russ things' and reprieves 4. Welcome to the top 10 â€¦ â€¦ Green Bay . The Packers (6.7 projected wins) tumbled after a 23-19 loss to the Steelers , and any hopes they had of parlaying a win over the Rams into a second-half surge might be gone already. The good news: Green Bay still has a 16.2-percent projected playoff chance, in large part because the remaining schedule includes games with the Panthers, Giants and Bears â€” not to mention a Lambeau Field date with the now 4-5 Buccaneers . The bad news is that the next three games are a gauntlet: the Chargers this Sunday, Thanksgiving Day in Detroit, then a home game versus the Chiefs . There's a trip to Minnesota looming in December, too. It's not that hard to see the Packers, even with all their issues on offense, getting into that six-to-seven-win range, as the projections expect. It'd take something awfully special to push them beyond that and back into the playoff picture. 5. A Super Bowl preview in Week 11? As things stand, the AFC playoffs would go through Kansas City (7-2) and the NFC through Philadelphia (8-1). Those teams will square up Monday night , in K.C., for what could be one of the games of the year. Not surprisingly, the Chiefs and Eagles also are sitting pretty in Mock's latest projections. Patrick Mahomes and company have the best Super Bowl shot (20.2 percent) and a whopping 96.8-percent chance to take the AFC West; Philadelphia is No. 2 on the Super Bowl list (15.2 percent), has the highest projected win total (13.1) and already is at 100 percent to make the playoffs (and 88.4 percent to win the NFC East).

The No. 1 Kansas Jayhawks take on the No. 17 Kentucky Wildcats in Chicago in one of the most anticipated early season games... Read In App Michigan State coach Tom Izzo pre-Duke press conference The No. 1 Kansas Jayhawks take on the No. 17 Kentucky Wildcats in Chicago in one of the most anticipated early season games of the 2023-24 campaign. Odds for Kentucky vs. Kansas Kansas opened as the 6.5-point favorite over Kentucky, according to FanDuel. The total is set at 147.5 while betting the straight money line is set at (-300) odds for Kansas while Kentucky is +240. Right now, the money is towards the Jayhawks. But based on the odds Kentucky is getting ahead of tip off, it might not be a bad bet for an early season matchup. ESPN win probability for Kansas vs. Kentucky Predicted winner: Kansas Win probability (for Kansas): 74.8% Matchup quality: 84.0 As far as ESPN is concerned, the outlet's Basketball Power Index rated the game's matchup quality at an 84, the third highest game Tuesday. Kansas' win probability is 74.8% and are projected to win by 7.1 points, similar to the odds. ESPN BPI is a model to provide a statistical comparison between two teams and predict future success. KenPom final score prediction for Kansas vs. Kentucky Predicted final score: Kansas wins 76-72 Win probability: Kansas â€“ 65% Finally, KenPom's projections have this one in favor of Kansas, a 76-72 win over Kentucky at the neutral site. This projection favors Kansas as well, however, it'll be a little closer than what ESPN predicts. How to watch: Channel: ESPN Location: Chicago (Ill.) The Champions Classic game between Kansas and Kentucky tips off in primetime, so it'll be a must-watch Tuesday night. Both teams come in at 2-0 on the season led by stars on both ends of the floor. For Kansas, Hunter Dickinson highlights the lineup after his transfer from Michigan this offseason. Dickinson put up 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists in a win over North Carolina Central to open the season. He followed it up with 18 points, eight rebounds and two assists versus Manhattan. On the flip side, guys like Antonio Reeves and Tre Mitchell operate for the Wildcats. Not only that, freshman DJ Wagner is one of the bright young stars to watch. Wagner put up 13 points, two rebounds and four assists in the opener against New Mexico State and followed it up with 11 points against Texas A&M-Commerce. This game won't necessarily dictate what's going to happen in March, but it'll certainly reveal the vibes around both programs. Kansas wants to get back to the national title game after winning it all in 2022. Kentucky meanwhile, hasn't quite played like Kentucky according to head coach John Calipari . That's a little different than Bill Self signing an amended lifetime contract .

No detail is too small to sweat The bill excludes funding requested by President Joe Biden for Israel, Ukraine and the U.S. border with Mexico. Johnson said separating Biden's request for an emergency supplemental bill from the temporary, stopgap measure places our conference in the best position to fight for fiscal responsibility, oversight over Ukraine aid, and meaningful policy changes at our Southern border. Hardline conservatives , usually loathe to support temporary spending measures of any sort, had indicated they would give Johnson some leeway to pass legislation, known as a continuing resolution, or CR, to give Congress more time to negotiate a long-term agreement.

Scott Applewhite, File) But some were critical in their reactions following the conference call. My opposition to the clean CR just announced by the Speaker to the @HouseGOP cannot be overstated, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, tweeted on X. Funding Pelosi level spending & policies for 75 days - for future â€˜promises.' The White House, meanwhile, panned the plan as unserious, unworkable and a threat to national security and domestic programs. This proposal is just a recipe for more Republican chaos and more shutdownsâ€”full stop, said press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, pointing to opposition from members of both parties. House Republicans need to stop wasting time on their own political divisions, do their jobs, and work in a bipartisan way to prevent a shutdown. The federal government is operating under funding levels approved last year by a Democratic-led House and Senate. Facing a government shutdown when the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Congress passed a 47-day continuing resolution, but the fallout was severe. Kevin McCarthy was booted from the speakership days later, and the House was effectively paralyzed for most of the month while Republicans tried to elect a replacement. Republicans eventually were unanimous in electing Johnson speaker, but his elevation has hardly eased the dynamic that led to McCarthy's removal â€” a conference torn on policy as well as how much to spend on federal programs. This past week, Republicans had to pull two spending bills from the floor â€” one to fund transportation and housing programs and the other to fund the Treasury Department, Small Business Administration and other agencies â€” because they didn't have the votes in their own party to push them through the House. A document explaining Johnson's proposal to House Republicans, obtained by The Associated Press, said funding for four spending bills would be extended until Jan. 19. Veterans programs, and bills dealing with transportation, housing, agriculture and energy, would be part of that extension. Funding for the eight other spending bills, which include defense, the State Department, Homeland Security and other government agencies would be extended until Feb. 2. The document sent to GOP lawmakers and key staff states that Johnson inherited a budget mess. He took office less than three weeks ago and immediately began considering appropriations bills through regular order. Still, with just days remaining before a shutdown, a continuing resolution is now required. Underscoring the concerns about the possibility of a shutdown, the credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service lowered its outlook on the U.S. government's debt on Friday to negative from stable, citing the cost of rising interest rates and political polarization in Congress. House Republicans pointed to the national debt, now exceeding $33 trillion, for Moody's decision. Analysts have warned that with interest rates heading higher, interest costs on the national debt will eat up a rising share of tax revenue. Johnson said in reaction to the Moody's announcement that House Republicans are committed to working in a bipartisan fashion for fiscal restraint, beginning with the introduction of a debt commission.

But newly elected Speaker Mike Johnson had to rely on support from Democrats to pass the bill after facing resistance from hard-right conservatives within his own partyâ€”a similar scenario to the one that led to his predecessor Kevin McCarthy being booted from the speakership. The short-term proposal passed by a vote of 336 to 95, with all but two Democrats voting in favor of the plan, which would extend government funding at current levels for some federal agencies until mid-January and others until early February. The bill now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it will likely pass ahead of the Nov. 17 funding deadline. The vote signaled potentially choppy political waters ahead for Johnson. We're trying to give the speaker a little grace, but today's a mistake, right out of the gate, said Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, one of the leaders of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Johnson acknowledged that the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), lacked distinct GOP policy wins but underscored the need to avert a government shutdown. He described his support for the plan as a strategic move that would provide the Republican conference with additional time to advance more conservative full-year spending plans. I believe that we can fight on principle and do these things simultaneously, Johnson said. When you have a small majority, it requires [that] some things are going to have to be bipartisan. While some hard-right Republicans expressed disappointment in Johnson for relying on Democrats, there have been no calls to remove the Louisiana congressman from his leadership post, which he has held for just three weeks. Johnson's political strategy echoes the approach taken by McCarthy, the previous Speaker who relied on Democratic votes to pass a stopgap spending bill on Oct. 1 only to be ousted by eight members of the conference days later. For now, Johnson appears to be benefiting from a political grace period as he settles into his new roleâ€”though that sentiment could change in the coming days. The internal Republican discord was palpable on Tuesday, with even members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus who supported McCarthy through the motion to vacate opposing the Johnson plan. Their grievances centered on the absence of border-security provisions, immediate spending cuts, and a general aversion to short-term spending patches, according to a statement released by the group. If you're storming the beaches of Normandy and the commanding officer goes down and somebody else takes over you don't say, â€˜Oh, well you get a honeymoon period,' Roy said. You got to pick it up and go. And so for me, this was a strategic failure. We should not do this. The House GOP bill shelves several priorities that Republicans have said they want to pass, including billions of dollars for Israel's military and tougher anti-immigration laws at the U.S.-Mexico border. And if the CR is approved, Republicans would essentially be funding the government at the same levels that were set in bipartisan fashion at the end of 2022, when Democrats controlled Congress, marking a failure by Republicans to cut federal government spending despite their slim majority in the House. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called the CR a very significant win on Tuesday, pointing to the GOP's decision not to cut spending levels or insert any conservative poison pill language. Although some Democrats were confused by the proposal's staggered deadlines for funding different parts of the federal governmentâ€”one on Jan. 19 and another on Feb. 2â€”House Democratic leaders announced their caucus would support the measure because it did not include any spending cuts or policy changes, and many of them saw no other way to prevent a shutdown. We have consistently made clear that a government shutdown would hurt the economy, our national security and everyday Americans during a very fragile time and must be avoided, top Democrats, led by House minority leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, wrote in a statement shortly before the vote. Read More: Lawmakers Almost Came to Physical Blows at the Capitol. Twice As the House engaged in discussions on the spending bill, tempers flared across the Capitol on Tuesday with a number of skirmishesâ€”some of them physicalâ€”adding to the sense of unruliness and dysfunction that has at times clouded Congress this year. At one point, Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee chased down McCarthy, accusing him of deliberately elbowing him with a clean shot to the kidneys as he passed him in the hallway. Hey Kevin, you got any guts? yelled Burchett, one of the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust McCarthy from his speakership. McCarthy denied he elbowed him. If I kidney punched someone, they would be on the ground, he said. Shortly after in the upper chamber, during a hearing, Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma challenged a witness to a fistfight. It's time to pass the CR and get the hell out of here, said Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Wouldn't that be nice? Everybody can calm down. The bill's fate now rests on the Senate, where Democrats have a slim majority and have signaled a willingness to accept Johnson's package ahead of Friday's deadline. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he supported the House proposal, calling it a solution that he expected would pass with bipartisan support. It's nice to see us working together to avoid a government shutdown, he said.

The Senate is expected to approve the proposal by week's end, effectively pushing a final showdown over government funding to the new year. House votes to prevent a government shutdown By Stephen Groves and Lisa Mascaro, The Associated Press Nov 15, 12:58 AM Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., meets with reporters ahead of a crucial vote on a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at its current levels, a measure not heartily supported by the hard right wing of his party, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2023. (Mariam Zuhaib/AP) WASHINGTON â€” The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to prevent a government shutdown after new Republican Speaker Mike Johnson was forced to reach across the aisle to Democrats when hard-right conservatives revolted against his plan. Johnson's proposal to temporarily fund the government into the new year passed on a bipartisan 336-95 tally, but 93 Republicans voted against it. It was the first time the new speaker had to force vital legislation through the House, and he showed a willingness to leave his right-flank Republicans behind and work with Democrats â€” the same political move that cost the last House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, his job just weeks ago. This time, Johnson of Louisiana appeared on track for a temporarily better outcome. His approach, which the Senate is expected to approve by week's end, effectively pushes a final showdown over government funding to the new year. Making sure that government stays in operation is a matter of conscience for all of us. We owe that to the American people, Johnson said earlier Tuesday at a news conference at the Capitol. The new Republican leader faced the same political problem that led to McCarthy's ouster â€” angry, frustrated, hard-right GOP lawmakers rejected his approach, demanded budget cuts and voted against the plan. Rather than the applause and handshakes that usually follow passage of a bill, several hardline conservatives animatedly confronted the speaker as they exited the chamber. Without enough support from his Republican majority , Johnson had little choice but to rely on Democrats to ensure passage to keep the federal government running. Johnson's proposal puts forward a unique â€” critics say bizarre â€” two-part process that temporarily funds some federal agencies to Jan. 19 and others to Feb. 2. It's a continuing resolution, or CR, that comes without any of the deep cuts conservatives have demanded all year. It also fails to include President Joe Biden's request for nearly $106 billion for Ukraine, Israel, border security and other supplemental funds. We're not surrendering, Johnson assured after a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday morning, vowing he would not support another stopgap. But you have to choose fights you can win. Johnson, who announced his endorsement Tuesday of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president, hit the airwaves to sell his approach and met privately Monday night with the conservative Freedom Caucus. Johnson says the innovative approach would position House Republicans to go into the fight for deeper spending cuts in the new year, but many Republicans are skeptical there will be any better outcome in January. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who is part of the House Freedom Caucus, threatened to take the House floor hostage if the chamber doesn't pass all of the appropriations bills by the deadlines. He said he would give a little bit of room to Johnson, who is three weeks into the job of speaker. But Roy did not hold back on his opinion of the funding bill: It's crap. The opposition from hardline conservatives left Johnson with few other options than to skip what's typically a party-only procedural vote, and rely on another process that requires a two-thirds tally with Democrats for passage. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries noted in a letter to colleagues that the GOP package met Democratic demands to keep funding at current levels without steep reductions or divisive Republican policy priorities. In a statement alongside other Democratic leaders, Jeffries said they would try to find common ground with Republicans whenever possible and pointed out that a federal shutdown would hurt the economy, our national security and everyday Americans. Winning bipartisan approval of a continuing resolution is the same move that led McCarthy's hard-right flank to oust him in October, days after the Sept. 30 vote to avert a federal shutdown. For now, Johnson appears to be benefiting from a political honeymoon in one of his first big tests on the job. Look, we're going to trust the speaker's move here, said Rep. Drew Ferguson, R-Ga. But Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a McCarthy ally who opposed his ouster, said Johnson should be held to the same standard. What's the point in throwing out one speaker if nothing changes? The only way to make sure that real changes happen is make the red line stay the same for every speaker. The Senate, where Democrats have a slim majority, has signaled its willingness to accept Johnson's package ahead of Friday's deadline to fund the government. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called the House package a solution and said he expected it to pass Congress with bipartisan support. It's nice to see us working together to avoid a government shutdown, he said. But McConnell, R-Ky., has noted that Congress still has work to do toward Biden's request to provide U.S. military aid for Ukraine and Israel and for other needs. Senators are trying to devise a separate package to fund U.S. supplies for the overseas wars and to bolster border security, but it remains a work in progress. If approved, passage of the continuing resolution would be a less-than-triumphant capstone to the House GOP's first year in the majority. The Republicans have worked tirelessly to cut federal government spending only to find their own GOP colleagues unwilling to go along with the most conservative priorities. Two of the Republican bills collapsed last week as moderates revolted. Instead, the Republicans are left funding the government essentially on autopilot at the levels that were set in bipartisan fashion at the end of 2022, when Democrats had control of Congress but the two parties came together to agree on budget terms. All that could change in the new year when 1% cuts across the board to all departments would be triggered if Congress failed to agree to new budget terms and pass the traditional appropriation bills to fund the government by springtime. The 1% automatic cuts, which would take hold in April, are despised by all sides â€” Republicans say they are not enough, Democrats say they are too steep and many lawmakers prefer to boost defense funds. But they are part of the debt deal McCarthy and Biden struck earlier this year. The idea was to push Congress to do better. The legislation also extends farm bill programs through September, the end of the current fiscal year. That addition was an important win for some farm-state lawmakers. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., for example, warned that without the extension, milk prices would have soared and hurt producers back in his home state. The farm bill extension was the biggest sweetener for me, said Pocan. Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Farnoush Amiri and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.

The same is true for other uses, but â€¦ this one really surprised me â€¦ what about putting a heat pump in your dryer? There's some insanely cool, or should I say hot, engineering inside this dryer that doesn't require a vent to the outside or a high voltage outlet. This thing runs off of a standard 15 amp household outlet and will use four to five times less electricity than a typical electric dryer. So if they're that good, why aren't they used everywhere? Well, I've been living with this Miele model for a while now and I have some thoughts on that. It's one of my favorite pieces of new tech in my home. It's kind of genius, but not perfect. How does this thing work â€¦ and are heat pump dryers even worth it?

Continue Reading Dell and Hugging Face partner to simplify LLM deployment November 15, 2023 by Arun Almost every enterprise today is at least exploring what large language models (LLMs) and generative AI can do for their business. Still, just as with the dawn of cloud computing and big data and analytics, many concerns remain: Where do they start in deploying the complex technology? How can they ensure the security and privacy of their sensitive, proprietary data? And what about time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning? Today, Dell and Hugging Face are announcing a new partnership to help address these hurdles, simplify on-premises deployment of customized LLMs and enable enterprises to get the most out of the powerful, evolving technology. The impact of gen AI and AI in general will be significant, in fact, it will be transformative, Matt Baker, SVP for Dell AI strategy, said in a press pre-briefing. This is the topic du jour, you can't go anywhere without talking about generative AI or AI, he added. But it is advanced technology and it can be pretty daunting and complex. Dell and Hugging Face â€˜embracing' to support LLM adoption Table of Contents Latest News With the partnership, the two companies will create a new Dell portal on the Hugging Face platform. This will include custom, dedicated containers, scripts and technical documents for deploying open-source models on Hugging Face with Dell servers and data storage systems. The service will first be offered to Dell PowerEdge servers and will be available through the APEX console. Baker explained that it will eventually extend to Precision and other Dell workstation tools. Over time, the portal will also release updated containers with optimized models for Dell infrastructure to support new-gen AI use cases and models. The only way you can take control of your AI destiny is by building your own AI, not being a user, but being a builder, Jeff Boudier, head of product at Hugging Face, said during the pre-briefing. You can only do that with open-source. The new partnership is the latest in a series of announcements from Dell as it seeks to be a leader in generative AI. The company recently added ObjectScale XF960 to its ObjectScale tools line. The S3-compatible, all-flash appliance is geared towards AI and analytics workflows. Dell also recently expanded its gen AI portfolio from initial-stage inferencing to model customization, tuning and deployment. Of the latest news, Baker noted with a laugh: I'm trying to avoid the puns of Dell and Hugging Face â€˜embracing' on behalf of practitioners, but that's in fact what we are doing. Challenges in adopting generative AI There are undoubtedly many challenges in enterprise adoption of gen AI. Customers report a plethora of issues, said Baker. To name a few: complexity and closed ecosystems; time-to-value; vendor reliability and support; ROI and cost management. Just as in the early days of big data, there's also an overall challenge in progressing gen AI projects from proof of concept to production, he said. And, organizations are concerned about exposing their data as they seek to leverage it to gain insights and automate processes. Today a lot of companies are stuck because they're being asked to deliver on this new generative AI trend, said Boudier, while at the same time they cannot compromise their IP. Just look at popular code assistants such as GitHub Copilot, he said: Isn't it crazy that every time a developer at an organization types a keystroke on a keyboard, your company source code goes up on the internet? This underscores the value in â€” and need for â€” internalizing gen AI and ML apps. Dell research has found that enterprises overwhelmingly (83%) prefer on-prem or hybrid implementations. There's a significant advantage to deploying on-prem, particularly when you're dealing with your most precious IP assets, your most precious artifacts, said Baker. Curated models for performance, accuracy, use case The new Dell Hugging Face portal will include curated sets of models selected for performance, accuracy, use cases and licenses, Baker explained. Organizations will be able to select their preferred model and Dell configuration, then deploy within their infrastructure. Imagine a LLama 2 model specifically configured and fine-tuned for your platform, ready to go, Baker said. He pointed to use cases including marketing and sales content generation, chatbots and virtual assistants and software development. We're going to take the guesswork out of being a builder, said Baker. It's the easy button to go to Hugging Face and deploy the capabilities you want and need in a way that takes away a lot of the minutiae and complexity. What makes this new offering different from the spate of others emerging almost daily is Dell's ability to tune top to bottom, Baker contended. This allows enterprises to quickly deploy the best configuration of a given model or framework. He emphasized that enterprises won't be exchanging any data with public models. It's your data and nobody else is touching your data except you, he said, adding that, once that model has been fine-tuned, it's your model. Every company a vertical Ultimately, tuning models for maximum output can be a time-consuming process, and many enterprises currently experimenting with gen AI are using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) alongside off-the-shelf LLM tools. RAG incorporates external knowledge sources to supplement internal information. The method allows users to find relevant data to create stepwise instructions for many generative tasks, Baker explained, and the pattern can be instantiated in pre-built containers. Techniques like RAG are a way of in essence not having to build a model, but instead providing context to the model to achieve the right generative answer, he said. Dell aims to further simplify the fine-tuning process by providing a containerized tool based on the popular parameter efficient techniques LoRA and QLoRA, he said. This is an important step when it comes to customizing models to specific business use cases. Going forward, all enterprises will have their own vertical, in fact, they themselves are vertical â€” they're using their specific data, Baker said. There's much talk of verticalization in AI, but that doesn't necessarily mean domain-specific models. Instead, it's taking your specific data, combining that with a model to provide a generative outcome, he said.

Che i maggiori consumi dannosi li fanno proprio le nuove generazioni che, rispetto ai danni causati nei decenni precedenti; non certo per importare robaccia cinese, erano dovuti anche e soprattutto all'arretratezza tecnologica. Con quell'arretratezza gli ingordi hanno creato aziende, fabbriche, cultura, scuole, strade, infrastrutture, ecc. che le povere vittime usano dalla nascita mentre al contempo vanno appresso alle minchiate sul debito pubblico brutto e cattivo (grazie all'opera di divulgazione dei grillini che di economia non hanno mai capito un cazzo e sono in parlamento da quasi 15 anni a fare chiacchiere da bar). Debito senza il quale starebbero tutti in miniera come i ragazzini che le povere vittime sfruttano per stare tutto il giorno su internet, sulla Playstation e a fare le troiette su Youporn e TikTok. Negli anni 70 e 80 incrociava (e affondava) una percentuale risibile di navi cargo rispetto ad oggi, tanto per fare un esempio; e soprattutto non trasportavano merci a basso costo fabbricate dagli schiavi in Thailandia per fare felici i ragazzini, ops, scusa, i vecchietti che affollano i centri commerciali. Magari una volta ognuno inquinava a casa sua e i ragazzini non avevano nÃ© la cultura, nÃ© la disponibilitÃ  economica per acquistare merce a basso costo prodotta a 20.000 km da casa e consegnate da uno schiavo che gli suona il campanello - festivi compresi - perchÃ© se no Amazon gli da una paga da fame. Oggi invece inquiniamo per importare fast fashion (e non sono certo le vecchie generazioni ad acquistare su Shein o Panda Buy) e per cambiare cellulare una volta all'anno con il quale fare balletti nudi per frustrazione e semplice zoccolaggine o per comprare a basso costo su Amazon che Ã¨ responsabile di buona parte del casino in corso.

Cone's life changed from watching the big screen to realizing a dream of being on the big screen himself. Jason Cone, a Statesboro resident, achieved a lifelong dream when he secured a background/extra role in one of his favorite franchises. Cone's life changed from watching the big screen to realizing a dream of being on the big screen himself. 00:02:36 Jason Cone, a proud Statesboro resident, had a dream come true when he was selected for a background/extra role in the film GearHeads, an exciting step for a man who was just a fan behind the big screen. Cone is still continuing his role as a background character in many other films that are soon to be released. Jason Cone and his wife are avid fans of The Walking Dead, a zombie series largely filmed in the Atlanta/Senoia area. They've gone on numerous trips to explore the show's filming locations, having visited over 70 different sites. Notably, Jason has amassed an impressive collection of Walking Dead comics and autographs. Around two years ago, Jason faced personal challenges that led him to rely on food and alcohol for solace, resulting in reaching a peak weight of 320 pounds. He also grappled with health issues, including type 2 diabetes. In the spring of 2022, his life took an unexpected turn when he stumbled upon an article about a spinoff of The Walking Dead called Fear the Walking Dead, which was relocating its production to Savannah for its final season. While he hadn't previously considered background acting, a local news station's call for extras on Facebook caught his eye. Jason viewed this as an opportunity to be part of one of his favorite TV series, motivating him to make significant lifestyle changes, including losing 40 pounds over three months. In November 2022, a role for GearHeads emerged, and Jason applied immediately, confident that his mechanical skills made him a suitable fit. To his delight, on November 14th, he received a booking offer for a GearHead role in an upcoming episode in season 8 of Fear the Walking Dead on AMC, called Iron Tiger. This opportunity allowed him to spend six full days on set, working closely with four main cast members, five other Gearheads, and portraying zombies, known as Walkers on the show. One of Jason's most cherished memories during filming was on his first day, where he found himself just an arm's length away from the lead actress in a gripping scene. He was part of the action as they held her at gunpoint to de-escalate a tense situation. The experience was nothing short of amazing. The cast and crew welcomed him warmly, and he thoroughly enjoyed his time on the show. Since then, he's continued his weight loss journey, shedding almost 80 pounds and participating in five other unreleased projects as a background extra.

Designed in 1978 by the eight-time Compasso d'Oro awardee Achille Castiglioni, this ceiling light is a piece of lighting historyâ€”a brilliant and essential lamp that, with a single bulb, manages to both directly illuminate the table surface with a precise cone of light and emit a diffused and reflected light that fills the entire room. A masterpiece of engineering and the study of the relationship between different geometric forms, it is completed by a judicious choice of materials. Like all lamps designed by Achille Castiglioni, it doesn't impose itself through eccentricity or the intensity of colors used but rather through its impeccable design, capable of transcending decades of style revolutions without ever going out of fashion. The central feature of the lamp, which gives the product its name, is the opaline polymethylmethacrylate disk, serving as a reflective and diffusing body, but perforated in the center to allow direct illumination to pass through. The disk is suspended and detached from the reflector by three slender harmonic steel cables. The central body, from which light radiates, is a reflection dome made of enameled and chrome-plated sheet metal on the outside.

Een kersttraditie die is overgevlogen uit de Verenigde Staten. De traditie begon in het gezin van Carol Aebersold. Haar kinderen wilden weten hoe de kerstman toch kon weten wie er â€˜zoet' of â€˜stout' was geweestâ€¦ Het antwoord kwam in de vorm van een Elf. Deze Elf werd officieel geadopteerd en ze gaven hem de naam â€˜Frisbee'. In de jaren die volgden verscheen Fisbee enkele weken voor de feestdagen. Zijn taak was de kinderen te observeren en â€˜s avonds verslag te doen aan de Kerstman. Iedere ochtend keerde hij weer terug en de kinderen troffen hem dan weer op een andere plek in huis aan. De Elfen halen een boel kattenkwaad uit, verkleden zich graag en zijn zelf beslist niet altijd even braaf. Hoe en waar tref je ze â€˜s ochtends aan? Net zo spannend als kijken of er iets in je schoentje zit! De regels om de magie te bewaren; - Adopteer je Elf officieel door hem zijn eigen naam te geven. - Raak de Elf niet aan, maar je mag hem Ã¡lles vertellen. - De Elf mag tegen de ouders spreken maar allÃ©Ã©n wanneer de kinderen dit niet horen. In het jaar 2006 adopteerden wij thuis onze â€˜Elf on the Shelf' bij Barnes & Noble in New York. Onze kinderen koesteren hier fijne herinneringen aan en net als Carol hoop ik dat deze kersttraditie plezier zal brengen in jullie huis. Geniet er van en geef er je eigen draai aan! De Elf is (als jongen en als meisje) verkrijgbaar in een mooie geschenkdoos samen met het boek â€˜The Elf on the Shelf, een Kersttraditie' dat Carol samen met haar dochter Chanda Bell schreef. De prachtige illustraties zijn van CoÃ« Steinwart.

ED CARSON 10:49 PM ET 11/14/2023 Dow Jones futures rose slightly overnight, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Big Microsoft ( MSFT ) artificial intelligence news is on tap Wednesday, while President Joe Biden will meet with China President Xi Jinping. X The stock market rally staged broad, powerful gains Tuesday after the October CPI inflation report cooled more than expected, sending Treasury yields plunging. MercadoLibre ( MELI ), Cloudflare ( NET ), Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) and Toll Brothers ( TOL ) were among the many stocks breaking out or flashing buy signals. They join Microsoft and Nvidia stock, which rose in buy zones Tuesday. Tesla stock rose solidly again, moving toward its 50-day line. Tesla ( TSLA ) archrival BYD ( BYDDF ) flirted with aggressive entries Tuesday. Microsoft AI News And Biden-Xi Microsoft will announce its latest AI advancements at its Ignite 2023 event on Wednesday, with some buzz that it could unveil its own AI chip to ease its dependence on Nvidia ( NVDA ). Nvidia unveiled a new AI chip earlier this week. Meanwhile, Biden and Xi will meet on the sidelines of the annual APEC conference in San Francisco. It's unclear if the meeting will offer clear signals of easing U.S.-Sino tensions. China is expected to lift a ban on Boeing ( BA ) 737 Max sales to Chinese airlines. Amazon, Microsoft and Nvidia stock are on IBD Leaderboard . Amazon stock and MercadoLibre are on SwingTrader . MSFT stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. MELI stock, Nvidia and Microsoft are on the IBD 50 . Cloudflare was Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day. Nvidia and MELI stock were selections last week. The video embedded in the article highlighted Tuesday's big market rally as well as analyzing DraftKings ( DKNG ), Super Micro Computer and TOL stock. Dow Jones Futures Today Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.3%. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session. Key News Chinese retail sales rose 7.6% vs. a year earlier in October, up from September's 5.5% and views for 7%. Industrial output grew 4.6%, just above estimates. Fixed-asset investment grew 2.9% in the first 10 months of 2023, slightly below views. At 8:30 a.m. ET, investors will get the October U.S. readings for the producer price index and retail sales. The House OK'd a short-term funding bill Tuesday afternoon to avert a government shutdown until at least early 2024. It passed with broad, bipartisan support. The Senate is expected to pass the measure soon. Earnings After the close, Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings ( NU ), backed by Warren Buffett, reported in-line Q3 earnings and revenue that slightly beat. NU stock fell solidly overnight. Shares jumped 4.5% to 8.83 on Tuesday, a 20-month high and extended from a buy zone. Berkshire Hathaway ( BKRB ) is set to release Q3 stock holdings soon, including any new positions. Early Wednesday, Target ( TGT ), TJX Cos. ( TJX ) and XPeng ( XPEV ) report. TJX stock is near a buy point, arguably actionable. XPEV stock is close to an aggressive entry. TGT stock is in a long downtrend, but rival Walmart ( WMT ), which report Thursday, is in a buy zone. Stock Market Rally The stock market rally made big gains in heavy volume Tuesday on the tame October CPI report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% in Tuesday's stock market trading . The S&P 500 index popped 1.9%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 2.4%, clearing the 14,000 level. The small-cap Russell 2000 gapped up 5.4% and the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ( RSP ) 2.85%. Both jumped above their 50-day lines, still below their 200-day averages. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF ( QQEW ) leapt 2.9%, now decisively above its 50-day while also clearing its October highs. The Nasdaq 100 gained 2.15%, closing in on its July 52-week high. The overall Nasdaq composite cleared the 14,000 level and is approaching its Sept. 1 short-term high, which roughly coincides with a trendline going back to the November 2021 all-time high. Leading stocks had a great day, with breakouts or buy signals from a wide array of sectors. After the big gains from late October, a real pause in the major indexes and leading stocks wouldn't be a surprise. But the overall picture has been quite bullish. The 10-year Treasury yield plunged 19 basis points to 4.44%, the lowest since late September. Markets see essentially no chance of further Fed rate hikes, and now see a May rate cut as likely. U.S. crude oil prices closed flat at $78.26 a barrel. ETFs Among growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ( IGV ) rose 2.7%. MSFT stock is a major IGV holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ( SMH ) popped just over 3%, with NVDA stock the largest component. Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ( ARKK ) soared 5.1% and ARK Genomics ETF ( ARKG ) surged 8.85%. Tesla stock is a huge holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. MELI stock, Cloudflare and BYD are also Cathie Wood holdings. SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF ( XME ) ran up 5.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ( XHB ) stepped up 5.9%, with TOL stock a member. The Energy Select SPDR ETF ( XLE ) rose 0.9% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLV ) climbed 0.7%. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLI ) gained 2% and the Financial Select SPDR ETF ( XLF ) 1.9%. Five Best Chinese Stocks To Watch Now Stocks In Buy Zones MELI stock popped 3.8% to 1,430.51, clearing a 1,398.59 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. But shares closed well off morning highs of 1,466.92. NET stock gapped up 10.5% to 70.61. Shares are still far from a 76.07 consolidation buy point . But Cloudflare stock cleared resistance around 66 and a downward-sloping trendline. Investors could have used 66.24 as an early entry. Amazon stock rose 2.25% to 145.80, testing a 145.86 buy point. Shares on Nov. 1 had already cleared a 134.48 early entry, which investors could view as a short double-bottom base. TOL stock leapt 8% to 85.98, surging out of an 82.39 cup-with-handle buy point , according to MarketSmith analysis . Toll Brothers and other housing stocks have roared back with Treasury yields tumbling. SMCI stock skyrocketed 14.9% to 293.87, racing past the 50-day line and clearing or flirting with various early entries around 287-295. Super Micro stock has a 317.50 buy point from an awkward double-bottom base. MSFT stock rose 1% to $370.27, in range from a 366.78 cup-base buy point. But shares are extended from the 50-day line. Microsoft stock offered early entries at the start of the month. Nvidia stock climbed 2.1% to 496.56, its 10th straight advance and a record close. Shares are rising within a buy zone from a double-bottom base. In addition to the Microsoft AI news on Wednesday, Nvidia earnings are due on Nov. 21. Tesla Stock Tesla stock leapt 6.1% to 237.41 on Tuesday, moving toward the 50-day line after rising 4.2% Monday to retake the 200-day line. TSLA stock could be starting to build the right side of a double-bottom base with a 278.98 buy point. A downward-sloping trendline, currently above 255, might offer an early entry. The EV giant outperformed the market, after Tesla slightly raised China prices on the base Model 3 and Y, the most-popular variants. That could pull forward some demand. Weekly registrations in China so far have lagged Q3's pace, despite the start of Highland Model 3 deliveries. Meanwhile, BYD stock climbed 2.7% to 31.96, rebounding from the 50-day line as well as topping a trendline entry and a very recent high.

The new type of radio emissions share properties with the northern lights spectrum commonly seen around Earth . Fresh insights about the intense radiation bursts from the Sun have been described in a study published in the journal Nature Astronomy. The discovery potentially opens new ways to understand similar phenomena in distant stars , said researchers, including those from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. This is quite unlike the typical, transient solar radio bursts typically lasting minutes or hours, said study co-author Sijie Yu. It's an exciting discovery that has the potential to alter our comprehension of stellar magnetic processes. Polar lights like the Aurora Borealis or Aurora Australis are visible across the sky on Earth closer to the North and South poles. They occur as solar activities disturb the Earth's magnetosphere, causing charged particles to precipitate along the polar regions, where the planet's magnetic field converges. The charged particles that converge here interact with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the high atmosphere and generate intense radio emissions at frequencies of about a few hundred kilohertz (kHz). In comparison, the newly observed solar radio emissions were detected over the temporary formation of a vast sunspot region where magnetic fields on the Sun's surface are particularly strong. The cooler and intensely magnetic sunspot areas provided a favourable environment, just like the magnetic polar caps on Earth, for these kinds of emissions to occur, scientists said. However, unlike the Earth's auroras, these sunspot aurora emissions occur at frequencies ranging from hundreds of thousands of kHz to roughly 1 million kHz â€“ a direct result of the sunspot's magnetic field being thousands of times stronger than Earth's, explained Dr Yu. Scientists said the radio bursts did not seem to be tied to the timing of the release of charged particles from the Sun as solar flares. Instead, the sporadic emission of flares in nearby regions seemed to pump energetic electrons nearer to sunspots. These flares then powered the stunning radio emissions. We aim to determine if some of the previously recorded solar bursts could be instances of this newly identified emission, said researchers. The characteristics resemble some of those observed on our planets and other distant stars, leading us to consider the possibility that this model could be potentially applicable to other stars with starspots, said Bin Chen, another study author.

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand the makeup of the U.S. veteran population and how it will change in coming decades. Information for this analysis comes from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Census Bureau and previously published Pew Research Center data, including a survey conducted March 13-19, 2023. More information on that survey's methodology , can be found in the originally published analysis. Racial and ethnic categories are taken from VA population projections. All racial groups include Hispanic adults unless specified. Hispanics are of any race. Veterans who served in the last 30 years make up the largest number of living veterans, according to population model estimates from the VA . Veterans from the Gulf War era, which spans from August 1990 through the present, surpassed Vietnam-era veterans in 2016. (Veterans who served in multiple eras are counted only in the earliest one.) Population estimates for 2023 show: 7.8 million living U.S. veterans, or 43%, served in the Gulf War era. 5.6 million living veterans (30%) served during the Vietnam War era from 1950 to 1973. Around 767,000 veterans who served during the Korean conflict in the 1940s and 1950s are alive today. They make up 4% of all living veterans. Fewer than 120,000 World War II veterans are alive today, making up less than 1% of all living veterans. As of 2023, roughly three-quarters (78%) of veterans served during wartime, and 22% served during peacetime. (Veterans with both types of service are only counted in wartime.) The share of the U.S. population with military experience has declined, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau . In 1980, about 18% of U.S. adults were veterans, but that share fell to 6% in 2022. This happened alongside a decrease in active-duty personnel after the military draft ended in 1973. The number of active-duty service members dropped from 3.5 million in 1968, during the military draft era, to about 1.3 million in today's all-volunteer force. Active-duty service members now comprise less than 1% of all U.S. adults. The VA projects that the number of living veterans will continue to decline over the next 25 years. The department estimates that the number of veterans will drop from today's 18.3 million to 12.1 million in 2048 â€“ a decrease of about 34%. By then, Gulf War-era veterans are projected to make up the majority of living veterans. As the number of veterans declines over the next 25 years, their demographics will shift, VA population models show. Women, Hispanic and Black adults, and adults under 50 will all make up larger shares of the total veteran population. Gender: The share of women veterans will increase from 11% this year to 18% in 2048. The overall number of women veterans is also expected to increase, from around 2 million to about 2.2 million. The number of male veterans, on the other hand, is projected to drop from about 16.2 million in 2023 to just under 10 million in 2048. Race and ethnicity: The share of non-Hispanic White veterans is projected to drop from 74% to 63%. The share of Hispanic veterans is expected to roughly double from 9% to 15%, while the share who are Black is expected to increase from 13% to 15%. This trend is in line with projections for the U.S. population overall . Age: Today, 28% of veterans are younger than 50, compared with a projected 34% in 2048, even as the share of older Americans overall is expected to grow . Fewer members of Congress have military experience than in the past, according to a Center analysis of the 118th Congress conducted after the 2022 congressional elections. In the current Congress, 18% of representatives and 17% of senators are veterans, down drastically from just a few decades ago. The share of senators who are veterans reached a post-Korean War peak of 81% in 1975, while the share among House members peaked in 1967 at 75%. In recent elections, both Democrats and Republicans have made concerted efforts to recruit veterans for congressional races . In the current Congress, 18 freshman lawmakers are veterans. Most Americans view the Department of Veterans Affairs favorably, according to a spring 2023 Center survey that asked Americans about 16 federal agencies. A slim majority of U.S. adults (56%) say they have a favorable opinion of the VA, 28% have an unfavorable view and 16% aren't sure. As with many of the agencies and departments asked about in the survey, there were partisan differences in opinions of the VA. While similar shares of partisans expressed approval of the VA, a larger share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents expressed dissatisfaction than Democrats and Democratic leaners (31% vs. 25%).

1221921189,WWW.REDDIT.COM,11/14/2023,REDDIT,FASHION COLLECTION 2010,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supra/comments/17v8r7s/an_honest_question_what_do_people_think_the_point/,r/Supra,"r/Supra An honest question - what do people think the point in the MK5 is? Edit: please see final paragraphs for edits. I ask this as a UK MKII owner. I was caught off-guard when Toyota announced the MK5. But even years later, I really cannot put my finger on exactly what Toyota was trying to accomplish with it. Here's my thoughts on it. Let's deal with the elephant in the room - BMW. I just don't understand why Toyota would take an existing car (the Z4) and slap such a legendary name as 'Supra' on it. Does it genuinely drive better than the Z4? Because I've seen the semi-joke posts about taking everything BMW off the MK5 and you're really not left with much more than cosmetics. I wondered if this was because maybe Toyota didn't feel confident with making a sports car after 2 decades of making sensible vehicles, but the GT-86 answers that - the tie-up with Subaru has been extremely well received and making an entirely new model made a lot of sense for both companies. The introduction of the Supra does explain why Toyota has strongly resisted the calls for a higher-performance GT-86 - they were reserving the market segment. The tie-up with BMW doesn't seem the same - they didn't develop the model together, they more or less looked over BMW's shoulder and said 'yeah, we'll take that.' In the release year, the Supra didn't even get the most powerful engine. BMW would obviously keep the best for themselves rather than supplying their competitor. What brought about this line of thinking was last week when I looked it up on Toyota's UK website in response to Doug Demuro's (rather rave) review of the manual. I've seen a couple of MK5s around here, though only a couple. Well, to my astonishment, the model you can buy brand new right now on Toyota UK's online store... is the 2020 spec. 335HP, automatic. And yet the UK has traditionally been a good (not spectacular but still good) market for the Supra. I just don't get it. Toyota have all this history with the Supra to draw from. The fact that the manual is such a big deal is really telling - the Supra was ALWAYS sold as both a manual and automatic, and the manuals routinely command higher prices - I see 10x as many auto MKIIs come up for sale as the manuals, and the manuals are always higher priced. They're the desirable car. It should have been a launch option. It should have been a 2021 option. Not THREE YEARS into the car's life. I mean, haven't most of the Supra fans who'd buy a MK5, now bought theirs? So I've been trying to rationalise this. It just feels so half-assed. Doug Demuro's first review of the MK5, he pointed out that Toyota deliberately plugged vent cutouts in the car so that tuners could make it their own, or in his words, 'Toyota deliberately didn't make it the best they could, so that someone else could.' That's just weird to me. And it leads me to some cynical conclusions. One, is that Toyota took very little risk in this venture. They took the already tried and proven Z4 as a starting point. BMW did all the R&D. BMW built the engine, which is already compliant with emissions worldwide. BMW built the drivetrain and the mechanical components (and that's a topic all on its own because it needs BMW service parts, not Toyota. That's a logistical nightmare.) BMW built the infotainment system. Seems to me all Toyota did was slap their logo where it was needed. But why take such little risk - they know how to take risks, they launched Lexus on a whim. Why no manual until long after all the preorders are done and the early adopters have theirs? ~~It's a slap in the face for real Supra fans.~~ Apologies to all who took offence at that statement. There's so few manual MK1-4 Supras left; the launch option would just make them rarer still. Maybe it's because the sports car market is becoming oversaturated. As technology has evolved, it seems everyone is getting in on making a performance car. Some of them are truly excellent. The technology is maturing. Which leads to the cynical thought of Toyota just wanting to get in on that and resurrect the Supra brand as a cash grab. Now I'm not trying to start a war here but I am slightly biased against BMW, I never liked my dad's company car. Now to a point, I can understand the engine - resurrecting the 2JZ and making it emissions-compliant would be a long and costly endeavour. And I hear that the B58 is good. But the rest of the car? I'm clearly not the target market for the MK5, so I'd really like to hear some insight on who is. Edit: okay, maybe I was a bit hyperbolic in this. I have never really looked that deeply into the relationship between the two cars, partially because it was never made clear without digging into it. The perception, because the Z4 was still in production for much of the design period of the MK5, the 2-seater design and the Z4 getting the bigger launch engine, definitely implies that the Supra was built on the Z4, not that the two cars are stablemates rather than derivatives. As I mentioned, the main reason for this post was seeing the 2020-spec Supra still offered by Toyota UK as of last week. That just seemed like neglect. All these reports of the much more powerful model and the manual finally appearing in the US, and no 'coming soon' or anything, just buy the 2020-spec 6-cylinder model now. As of today at least, that has changed, and the manual is now offered by Toyota UK. Though the 335HP option was still the only 6-cylinder until last week; I looked around and couldn't find the uprated one, again making me think this was neglect.",positive,,EN,,,3,UNKNOWN,90,49,0,0,0,49,0,N,,,24962,r/Supra,gargravarr2112,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,7488,0,0,P00,,,P

Hey guys, I'm in the market for a new (to me) truck and would really appreciate your input. My primary reason for wanting medium duty truck is that I need something capable of handling a small folding boom (6000-8000 lbs lift capacity), along with having a usable payload of around 6000-8000 lbs (excluding the deck and crane). Here are some key details: * My budget is around $25K CAD ($20K USD), but I'm open to spending less. * Only needed for about 5000 kms (3000 mi) annually, with many trips ranging from 20-50 km (12-35 mi). * I only want a 10-12 ft flat deck (for urban hardwood tree collection), to allow for greater maneuverability in tight spaces 14ft max. * 4x4 (6x6) is a big plus, as I live in Canada with a steep hill up to my place (8 deg / 14% slope). I'd prefer not to chain up every time in winter. That said, my usage is 80% spring-fall, so RWD only is an option, just not ideal. * Towing needs are relatively moderate, ranging from a dump trailer (14k-16k lbs max) to a flat deck (14k max). Typical loads are around 5000-12,500 lbs. Might get a larger gooseneck one day, but any truck should handle my towing needs. Typically within a few hundred kilometers, not thousands. I'm considering a few trucks, but I'm currently leaning towards something smaller like a Ford F550 or Dodge 5500. I'd prefer something older, pre-emissions, for simplicity and because of the shorter trips. Probably no delete, as it's only a matter of time before it they start cracking down on it in my province. I have considered a F550 with the 6.8 V10 gas, due to shorter trips and lots of idling for the crane, but would prefer a diesel. I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

Signed new supply contract with the U.S. Department of Defense of $2.2 million for portable power systems. Received order from a prominent fuel cell integrator in the Asian market with initial value of $1.3 million. Unveiled Advent's range of Serene Power Systems at the 2023 Monaco Yacht Show. Continued discussions with the Greek State to finalize its procedures for state aid funding of Advent's Green HiPo project, following official ratification from the European Commission under the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) Hy2Tech Program. BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADN) (Advent or the Company), an innovation-driven leader in the fuel cell and hydrogen technology space, today announced consolidated financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2023. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Q3 2023 Financial Highlights (All comparisons are to Q3 2022, unless otherwise stated) Revenue of $1.3 million and income from grants of $0.5 million, for a total of $1.8 million. Operating expenses of $11.0 million, a year-over-year increase of $0.3 million, primarily related to an increase in expenses for our new Hood Park facility in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Net loss in Q3 of $(11.8) million or $(0.20) per share. Unrestricted cash reserves were $3.7 million as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of $6.4 million from June 30, 2023, which includes $2.1 million of cash raised from the Company's equity line of credit with Lincoln Park Capital and a final payment of $0.7 million for the build-out of the Hood Park facility. The consolidation of our global operations continued during Q3 2023, which has driven efficiencies and contributed to the reduction of our cash burn. We will continue to consolidate the business as we commercialize our portfolio and expand our production pipeline, said Dr. Vasilis Gregoriou, Chairman and CEO of Advent Technologies. Our HT-PEM technology is very attractive to the transportation sector, and this is reflected across applications for maritime, aviation, and automotive. Our goal is to forge partnerships like the ones announced with Hyundai and Airbus which will provide financial support and help us accelerate the development of the technology. These partnerships will actively support our R&D and investment efforts and provide a clear path to commercialization. Furthermore, we are actively developing our pipeline for the stationary power (diesel generator replacement) market, where we see increased commercial interest for deployments in 2024. We shall remain focused on successfully developing innovative fuel cell systems and expanding our collaboration agreements with world-class partners. Business Updates Airbus Term Sheet to launch a Joint Benchmarking Project: On November 6, 2023, Advent announced the signing of a term sheet with Airbus, a global leader in aeronautics, space, and related services, for a joint benchmarking project regarding an optimized Ion Pairâ„¢ Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) for hydrogen fuel cells. Airbus will provide financial support to the project and its extensive knowledge of the aviation industry. Advent will invest in people, materials, hardware, and 3rd party research centers to contribute to the goals of the project. The multi-million dollar collaboration will take place over two years. A contract based on the signed term sheet is expected to be signed by the end of 2023, and the project will commence immediately thereafter in 2024. The goal of the project is to accelerate the development of Advent's MEA and benchmark the Ion Pair MEA against aviation requirements and current/expected technological limits. HT-PEM MEAs operating at temperatures higher than 180Â°C (360Â°F) aim to solve one of the largest challenges in aviation fuel cell use: thermal management. High temperature fuel cells allow increased performance, increased passenger carrying capability, and increased range compared to low temperature fuel cell stack technology. Advent believes that HT-PEM is a superior option not only for aviation, but also for heavy-duty trucks, the automotive industry and marine use. New Contract with the U.S. Department of Defense: Advent secured a new $2.2 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). This milestone achievement comes under the General Technical Services prime contract and will play a crucial role in supporting the demanding mission requirements of the U.S. Army. This contract is the continuation of a series of past contracts with the U.S. DoD, and its primary objective is to further optimize Advent's proprietary Honey Badger 50â„¢ (HB50) portable fuel cell system by integrating the Company's innovative Ion Pair MEA technology. Upon the completion of this new 12-month contract, Advent and the U.S. DoD aim to reinforce their long-term collaboration by focusing on the manufacturing process of the enhanced HB50 fuel cell system that will enable high-volume production manufacturing capacity. Advent's Ion Pair MEA technology is anticipated to significantly enhance HB50's performance, resulting in higher power density in an improved, more compact package, making it an ideal solution for off-grid field applications, including military and rescue operations. Since 2020, Advent has been actively improving its HB50 fuel cell system to create a highly portable and efficient power supply suitable for on-the-move battery charging and direct power supply for various U.S. Army applications. Through rigorous development efforts, the size and weight of the original 50W fuel cell system have been significantly reduced, culminating in successful field tests in 2022 and 2023, with the final technical report reinforcing its operational suitability. The HB50 power system can be fueled by biodegradable methanol, providing near-silent power generation with clean emissions. Its compact design allows it to seamlessly power radio and satellite communications apparatus, remote surveillance systems, laptops, and other battery charging needs, making it an ideal choice for covert operations. The system's unique thermal features enable it to operate within a wide ambient temperature range from considerably below freezing to at least 40Â°C (104Â°F), therefore ensuring reliability in challenging conditions and climates. HB50's adaptability to run on methanol as a hydrogen carrier allows it to operate at a fraction of the weight of traditional military-grade batteries. This factor is aligned with the U.S. DoD's pursuit of lightweight and highly portable power solutions for their electronic needs, especially in conjunction with Integrated Visual Augmentation System and dismounted leader situational awareness systems for use during combat operations, like Nett Warrior. Significant Expansion Order Contract with a Prominent Fuel Cell Integrator: Advent secured a significant expansion order contract with a prominent fuel cell integrator operating in the Asian market. Under the terms of the agreement, Advent will provide its innovative eFuel-powered (Serene) fuel cell stacks to be incorporated in power applications within the leisure sector in the region. The contract has a total initial value of $1.3 million. The supply chain is projected to remain active throughout 2024 in accord with the customer's specified timeline. The primary application of Advent's fuel cell stacks is to serve as sustainable prime and back-up power sources in small cabins, working in conjunction with batteries. The market for portable fuel cells, especially in the context of the leisure industry, is currently niche.

For those with a newer 20'-23' Mini you'll know due to regulations they no longer pop or burble on overrun. Since i live in NA we are lucky to not have the GPF/OPF fitted in our cars but regardless of whether you have it or not, the lack of pops and burbles lies in the new software used in these models. It's all because of emissions because as you know, pops and burbles are essentially just unburnt fuel igniting in your exhaust chamber. So whether you fancy out with a JCW pro exhaust or go old-school and straight pipe your MINI, there will be no pops or bangs coming from the tailpipe. Just like any other BMW/MINI you'd think it would be easy to reflash the ECU with a burble tune but unfortunately, due to the new Bosch MG1 ECU's that BMW has started using, getting a DME unlock done for a full reflash requires you to ship out your DME to a company in Finland. However, PRZPerformance in Italy has software that they use to download a new map table very similar to our older model MINI's that came stock with pops and bangs. Best of all they offer remote coding services which is how I was able to get it done!

Published September '23, this remarkable new study asks skeptics' questions and concludes that no case can be made for the CO2 hypothesis. https://www.ssb.no/en/natur-og-miljo/forurensning-og-klima/artikler/to-what-extent-are-temperature-levels-changing-due-to-greenhouse-gas-emissions - These data indicate that warmer temperatures were the norm in the earlier part of the past 4,000 years, including century-long intervals nearly 1Â°C warmer than the decade (2001-2010). Therefore, it appears that the current decadal mean temperature in Greenland has not exceeded the envelope of natural variability over the past 4,000 years ... These reconstructions show that during the past 10,000 years temperatures over long periods were higher than they are today. The warmest phase occurred 4,000 to 8,000 years ago and is known as the Holocene Climate Optimum or the Atlantic Period. - **It therefore appears that the different temperature records might not be of equal scientific quality.** While both NCDC and GISS seem to have undergone quite large administrative changes, and therefore might be considered unstable, the changes introduced to HadCRUT3 are fewer and smaller (Figure 1B in Appendix B). It is apparent that the degree of uncertainty (measurement errors) in these global temperature series have changed over time. - While some of the relations in GCMs are based on well-established theory from physics, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, there are representations that are only approximations and not based on physical laws ... The parameters in these relationships are calibrated so that the model fits the weather and climate observations in a selected period. - These results are therefore consistent with the results obtained by Dagsvik et al. (2020). In other words, the results imply that the effect of man-made CO2 emissions does not appear to be sufficiently strong to cause systematic changes in the pattern of the temperature fluctuations. In other words, our analysis indicates that with the current level of knowledge, it seems impossible to determine how much of the temperature increase is due to emissions of CO2. Note that the authors prefer to use HadCrut3 as a source owing to it not being corrupted by adjustments.

Bergmeyer+ helps retailers create granular and achievable sustainability plans, and it's starting with an area that's often overlooked: store fixtures. Have Big Sustainability Goals? Bergmeyer+ Says to Start Small â€” with Store Fixtures November 14, 2023 at 8:40 AM EST By Adam Blair Who is Danny-stock.Adobe.com Sustainability goals are all well and good, but too often they remain just that â€” goals rather than actual, measurable achievements. Sometimes this is due to deliberate greenwashing, but more often it's a problem of planning and execution, according to Christian Davies, Principal at Bergmeyer+ , the new sustainability-focused division of retail design firm Bergmeyer , operating in partnership with SMS Collaborative . In our first conversation with [SMS CEO and Founder] Annie Bevan, she kept repeating that â€˜You have to be specific about what you mean and what you can do,' when it comes to sustainability initiatives, said Davies in an interview with Retail TouchPoints. Companies often start by saying â€˜We'll be net-zero by 2050,' but that's a long way away, and we don't have that long. When we ask companies how they'll get to that goal and say â€˜Let's talk about your roadmap for an 18-month plan,' there's nothing there. Bergmeyer+ represents an attempt to help retailers create specific, granular and achievable sustainability plans, offering both consulting and operational services to turn those plans into realities. And it's starting with an area that's often overlooked: store fixtures. Davies sees significant growth potential for the division â€” and the possibility to effect real change for the industry on a vast scale. Retail TouchPoints (RTP): Why did Bergmeyer+ start with a focus on fixtures? Advertisement Christian Davies: We had lots of conversations about areas like store lighting and construction, but we focused on fixtures because they've been flying under the radar. The LEED [environmental rating system] puts them in the furniture bucket. But when we began looking at the whole fixture industry, we found that it was an enormous machine, and we also uncovered how little has been done. The fixtures in any store probably weren't designed with sustainability in mind, nor manufactured in sustainable ways, or they were shipped without any thought about the carbon impact of getting them to the store. Probably one of the biggest things was that there's usually no plan for their end of life, which means they end up in landfills almost all the time. The potential is all massive upside, since any one of those four buckets has huge potential for change. RTP: What kinds of actions can have the biggest impact in making store fixtures more sustainable? Davies: This goes all the way back to [the way we train] students in design school, and it's about understanding the impact of design upfront. Typically we design fixtures based on what the client wants, and then we figure out ways to make them as green as possible. But if you start with a blank sheet of paper and look at it with a sustainability lens, you might end up at a completely different place. [Designing that way is] infinitely easier than retrofitting. The same concept applies to the store as a whole. One retailer we're talking to has beautiful existing stores, and they're asking How can we make the greenest version of that store? That's meaningful and profound work. But, if you went back to the drawing board to build a store that started through the green lens, it would probably look completely different than that existing store. Maybe both of those exercises are valid â€” you clean up [what you have] as best you can, and the other one would be a store of the future. RTP: Can you provide an example of designing for sustainability? Davies: One of the things we show people is based on the Reitveld Crate chair, which is basically an Adirondack-style chair made out of only eight pieces of lumber. Its form is determined by the raw materials rather than branding and aesthetics, and the only waste [created] is the sawdust from the cross-cut saw and the drill holes. That's a mindset shift from the design standpoint. Another element is, when you have two pieces to fit together, do you bolt them or weld them? If you bolt them, when you're done with that fixture you can take it apart, and its pieces can be refinished or reused; you can't do that if they are welded together. That's a profound difference. RTP: How do you tie these types of small but important changes to broader sustainability actions? Davies: Broadly, we benchmark and evaluate the three big C's â€” carbon, chemistry (toxicity) and circularity (waste) of current store fixture programs. These are the bones of any sustainability initiative, but they're interconnected. Say you wanted to remove all toxic materials from anything in your store â€” but the supply of these [non-toxic] fixtures might come from much further away, [adding to your carbon footprint]. It's a question of which one you want to start with. One of the things we're most excited about is a return to U.S. domestic manufacturing [of fixtures]. There used to be a thriving fixture industry, but a lot of those skills have been lost from a labor standpoint. [Nearshoring] would have enormous implications for resources, shipping and transportation, and it could even open up new manufacturing opportunities like using 3D printing. That gets a bad rap because the [raw material] is plastic, but you can get it formulated to be biodegradable. More importantly, down to the micron level, 3D printing uses just enough material [to make what you] need; there's no waste. But it's much harder to manage that [process] on the other side of the world. It's also important to note that we're not limited to the three C's; other elements include equity and inclusion of local communities and workforces. I'm imagining, say, five years from now, when a retailer could say, We're making everything for our stores within a 100-mile or a 300-mile radius of each store, and made with local labor. A big retailer might have five separate factories around the country making fixtures for its U.S. store network. These are not pipe dreams; we're seeing retailers like Arc'teryx testing them out. RTP: Are there retailers today that you think are doing a good job with their sustainability initiatives? Davies: The gold standard we've been using is Marks & Spencer's Plan A . (It's called that because there is no Plan B.) They made something like 200 sustainability pledges that they would try to hit, and systematically worked to knock those dominoes down â€” and every time they hit one, they re-up another one. Plan A is filled with specificity, timelines and roadmaps. But as many successes as Plan A has had, it also uncovered huge blind spots, or spots where people said, This is much more difficult than we thought it would be. Regardless of these blind spots, they've seen a 76% reduction in refrigeration energy use, and 90% of their packaging is now easily compostable. RTP: Can you give me an overview of how you operate with retail clients? Davies: The first step toward making meaningful change is to come to a common understanding of language, standards and ways to measure things. In super-simplistic terms, steel might be rated a six while aluminum might be rated a seven on a sustainability scale, so we can say that as an industry, if you make things out of one material, it's better than making things out of the other. We say to retailers that over time they can impact their sustainability footprint, but only if we can all agree on what the metrics are. Then we'll have the goals conversation with retailers. We review what they've said [about sustainability] and decide if it's applicable and meaningful â€” and if it's not, we help them change, improve or even",positive,,EN,,,"4,01",UNKNOWN,1289,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Store-fixtures_WhoIsDanny.jpg,171811,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,51543,0,0,P00,,,P

Il problema ad esempio non Ã¨ rappresentare una persona grassa come trasandata o poco stilosa perchÃ¨ le persone grasse possono essere tutto questo. Il problema Ã¨ puntare sullo stereotipo di una persona grassa come di una persona trasandata o poco stilosa A CAUSA del suo corpo, come se fosse AUTOMATICO. Ed Ã¨ proprio questo automatismo che crea lo stereotipo e diffonde una cultura basata su falsi miti. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Representation is not only 'aesthetics', but it's a model that influences our culture - as a set of beliefs, ideas and behaviors.

UK Sikhs feel uneasy and overlooked after Canada killing James PHEBY 15 November 2023 at 4:48 am Â·4-min read Expatriate Sikhs are concerned about India's crackdown on the separatist Khalistan movement (Oli SCARFF) Britain's Sikh population, whose ancestors first migrated from the Punjab more than a century ago, have long been admired as a model of integration and for maintaining a strong identity. Lauded in their country of origin and beyond for their valour, industriousness and charity, Sikhs took those values to Britain, which during the country's imperial past praised them as a martial race. ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement They won accolades for standing up to rioters in London in 2011, for charity work during the coronavirus pandemic, and most recently for feeding the hungry during the cost-of-living crisis. We don't often complain, Jas Singh, adviser to the Sikh Federation UK, which represents some 500,000 Sikhs in the UK, told AFP at the Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Smethwick, near Birmingham in central England. But the tight-knit community is now appealing for help to address long-term issues such as racism and a lack of representation in politics and culture. We still need help just like everybody else, said Kulbinder Kaur Gakhal, an education administrator at the Smethwick gurdwara, one of the oldest and largest in Europe. The fact that we only have two Sikh MPs. Given our numbers, we should have maybe six or seven. Across the civil service, there's very low Sikh representation -- in the police, in education, added Jas Singh. This is a wall of discrimination that we face, he added. Despite official figures showing a 169 percent rise in attacks on Sikhs in 2021/22, there is no approved definition for anti-Sikh hate crimes in the UK. - Fresh worries - A statue outside the gurdwara paying tribute to the many Sikhs who fought with the UK in the world wars is frequently vandalised, said Gakhal. They have security cameras and information that's led them to know who's done it. But the authorities aren't able to pinpoint, so it's a shame, she added. But it is an Indian crackdown on the Khalistan movement, which wants an independent Sikh state in India, and its wider global fallout that has left many in the community particularly concerned. New Delhi has banned the movement as a security threat and taken a particular interest in those close to Amritpal Singh, a firebrand Sikh leader who was arrested in April in India after a month-long manhunt. In February, hundreds of his supporters, some carrying swords and guns, had pushed past barricades outside a police station near Amritsar, demanding the release of an aide held inside. Protests were held around the world over the manhunt, including in London, where Avtar Singh Khanda -- a friend of Amritpal Singh -- was accused by Indian media of pulling down an Indian flag. The 35-year-old activist, who was never named by UK police as a suspect, died on June 15 after suddenly falling ill with blood cancer. His funeral at the Smethwick temple, which has pro-Khalistan flags flying outside, was attended by thousands. - Shockwaves - The announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September that there were credible allegations linking India to the killing of another pro-Khalistan activist in Toronto on June 18 sent shockwaves through the Sikh diaspora. Story continues India strenuously denies any links, but the announcement prompted Khanda's family and friends to demand a coroner's inquest into his death. I don't know what investigation they did, but it would have only taken a few hours, Amit Singh, a volunteer at Smethwick-based Punjab broadcaster PBC, told AFP. The community feels that they definitely didn't take anything seriously. Until an investigation occurs, doubt will remain, added Singh, who was with Khanda shortly before he was taken to hospital. The High Commission of India in London did not reply to an AFP request for comment on the case. According to Jas Singh, more broadly there was now a high level of apprehension and fear among Britain's Sikhs, especially those who travel back to India. There is extra security at the gurdwara. It's disappointing that the police and the authorities have not reached out to the community, he added. He believes the UK government's desire to secure a trade deal with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government has led them to ignore the community's concerns. Not only do we have their silence, but we also have them going the other way with (UK Prime Minister) Rishi Sunak announcing pro-Khalistan extremism as an issue. Sikhs have no arrests, no pending cases, no threat or risk to British interests, he added. jwp/phz/fg/smw ",negative,,EN,,,"0,74",SINGAPORE,30818,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.com.sg/d573f6bd431e6a28eda4936b756ebb43,316829574,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,95048872,0,0,P00,,,P

Toyota's Camry, best-selling car in US, goes all-hybrid Joseph White 15 November 2023 at 4:03 am Â·3-min read Visitors look at a Toyota Camry car during the Bangkok Auto Salon 2019 in Bangkok By Joseph White DETROIT (Reuters) - The next generation of the Toyota Camry, the best-selling sedan in the U.S. market, will come with only a gas-electric hybrid powertrain, the boldest move yet by the Japanese automaker to push hybrid technology into the heart of the U.S. market. The 2025 Camry will combine a 2.5-liter gasoline engine with an electric drive system tuned to deliver more power in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive versions of the car, Toyota said. ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement Compliance with tougher U.S. fuel economy rules was a factor in Toyota's decision to make the new Camry an all-hybrid vehicle line, dropping four- and six-cylinder combustion models that made up about 85% of sales in the current model year, David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told Reuters. Another factor behind the decision was the performance we were able to get out of the hybrid, he said. While Toyota has accelerated development of electric-vehicle technology, it is still betting that demand for hybrids and plug-in hybrids will remain robust as the automaker takes a multi-pathway approach seeking to satisfy customer needs in every market. The hybrid powertrain and a new electronic all-wheel drive system deliver 232 combined horsepower â€“ nearly 15% more than the outgoing Camry with a mechanical all-wheel drive system, Toyota said. Toyota executives unveiled the ninth generation of the midsized Camry sedan on Tuesday in Los Angeles, ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show that opens on Friday. The new Camry will compete in a segment largely abandoned by the Detroit brands, with the exception of General Motors' Chevrolet Malibu. The new Camry's direct competitors - putting aside scores of compact and midsized SUVs - will include a few remaining sedans such as the Honda Accord, the Hyundai Sonata and Tesla's all-electric Model 3. The Tesla Model 3 outsold the Camry in California, a key market for Toyota, during the first nine months of 2023, according to data from the California New Car Dealers Association. Toyota did not disclose pricing or fuel-efficiency figures for the 2025 Camry, due in showrooms next spring. The cheapest Camry hybrid model currently sells for about $2,400 more than the most inexpensive combustion Camry. Most of the hybrid powertrains sell at a $1,500 to $2,000 premium to combustion models, Christ said. We think the value the hybrid powertrain brings is worth that kind of premium. A current Camry hybrid is rated at 52 miles (84 km) per gallon in combined city and highway driving, compared with a 32-mpg rating for the conventional four-cylinder Camry. The hybrid saves $650 a year in fuel costs compared with the combustion model, according to U.S. government fuel economy data. Toyota previously switched its Sienna minivan to an all-hybrid powertrain approach. The Sienna is our second-fastest turning car and the car we have the most reservations for, Christ said.

It looks good, it sounds cool when shared, and, supposedly, it's beneficial for the planet. The reason why â€˜supposedly' is so important, unfortunately, is because the operative word is â€˜credit'. For far too many brands, presenting a positive face is more important than actually doing positive work, and this leads to a sea of greenwashing, in which actual environmentally-friendly brands can have a hard time standing out. Take Australian wine producer Banrock Station, for instance. While the brand carries an immense history of supporting the environment - not just in Australia, but around the world - via a global environmental trust, and the commitment to plant 100,000 trees annually, this isn't something that's known to most people. In fact, most Canadians didn't know much about the brand, periodâ€¦ until recently, that is. Thanks to the efforts of creative agency Bleublancrouge (BBR), the two worked together to make a dent in the northern market with a multi-pronged campaign. Emphasising the environment-first appeal of the brand, the two directly appealed to young, ecologically-minded wine drinkers by publicising the brand's partnership with Tree Canada , and its commitment to plant 5,000 trees across the country for every bottle sold. But that wasn't all. To really drive this home, the agency partnered with sustainable Canadian fashion brand ecologyst to create a lookbook, bridging the worlds of high fashion, tree planting, and wine appreciation in a visual fusion - also known as â€˜Tree Planter Chic'. Featuring fun hats, bright colours, bubbly bottles and bold enamel pins, these were further brought to life by live, pop up events in Toronto and Victoria, creating a fun, refreshing, and impactful Canadian campaign. To learn more, LBB's Josh Neufeldt sat down with the team from BBR, including executive creative director Julie Markle, strategist Alec Pavlich, VP, client leadership Nadine Arsenault, creative director Bruce Harris, account supervisor Jonathan Cafarelli, and producer Casey Tanaka. LBB> Standing out against a sea of greenwashing, and breaking an Australian wine into Canada is no small task! As such, what was the brief for this campaign, and what immediate ideas came to mind? BBR> When it comes to eco creds, Banrock Station has them in spades. The Australian wine producer touts over 25 years of history supporting the environment in Australia, and around the world. The brand offers sustainably-produced vegan wine, runs a global environmental trust, and is committed to planting 100,000 trees annually. As such, BBR's task was to craft a locally-relevant campaign targeting young, environmentally conscious wine lovers, by highlighting Banrock Station's CSR partnership with Tree Canada, the country's only national non-profit tree planting organisation. The challenge, however, was that we wouldn't be the first brand to be planting trees with purchase. From toilet paper to other wine brands, it feels like everyone has promoted their commitment to planting trees in Canada at some point - usually by showing sunlit forests. So, with more greenwashing than ever, Canadians can be quick to tune out claims. With no planned media dollars, we knew we had to approach our creative ideas differently. To this end, we sought to develop ideas that were relevant to our core target audience, and had the legs to generate some earned buzz and impressions. We ended up settling on the idea that â€˜Anyone Can Be A Tree Planter' as an inclusive brand platform. Because, even if you are not physically present in the forest replanting, your actions as a consumer can have positive consequences. As well, from the get-go, we knew partnering with suppliers and brands that walk the walk would help us reach our market on a tight budget. LBB> Specifically, crossing the worlds of wine, fashion and the environment is not something you see every day! How did this idea come to pass, and what made it the right approach for the job? BBR> Research indicates that only 29% of consumers know which wine brand they intend to purchase before they enter a store, and that 15% of consumers spend 10 seconds or less choosing their wine (Nielsen, 2017). Therefore, it was imperative that we built a brand connection with our consumers ahead of them entering the store. We knew our audiences cared deeply about the planet, but also about looking good, which led to â€˜Tree Planter Chic' - the marriage of our inclusive message and a sustainable fashion partnership. LBB> Building on this, why was speaking to the demographic of young, ecologically-minded wine drinkers so important? What made them the ideal target to base a campaign around? BBR> We know we are not the first to go after this customer group, but, in working with a lesser-known Australian wine producer, we felt it was important to get in front of the next generation of Canadian wine drinkers who are beginning to explore the space and develop their palates. Cultivating brand awareness with the generation set to inherit the Earth plants the seeds for a community of advocates who stand proudly in support of Banrock Station and Canadian forests. LBB> Strategically, how does one plan for/start a creative endeavour such as this? Did you immediately contact a fashion brand to get the ball rolling? BBR> We knew finding the right fashion partner was critical - one that was Canadian, had a like-minded, sustainable mission, and of courseâ€¦ that was fashionable. We explored several options and narrowed it down based on aligned values and audience. From there, it was good ol' fashion cold-calling to gauge interest and identify key decision makers, landing a partner who would help push our vision forward. LBB> And what made ecologyst the right partners for this campaign? BBR> ecologyst was the perfect partner for this campaign because of its ethos on fashion sustainability in the Canadian market. Not only is it Canadian owned, the brand also manufactures all its clothing in Canada using sustainable materials - something we were able to utilise to create our custom five-panel hats. Additionally, ecologyst, based on the West Coast, was looking for further exposure in Ontario, so this partnership was a natural win-win for Banrock Station and ecologyst. LBB> What was the lookbook design process like? How did you collaborate to combine fashion and effectively showcase the impact of purchasing Banrock? BBR> In the spirit of sustainability, the looks themselves featured a mix of sustainable elements: various ecologyst pieces (including our tree planter hats), enamel pins (made of recycled metal), and pre-loved clothing. Authentic tree planting bags were equally essential to each look, filled appropriately with saplings and, of course, chilled bottles of Banrock Station's Pink Moscato. Overall, the vision of our stylist, Marie-Eve Tremblay, was to glam up the tree-planter look, which is ordinarily less than fashionable. To do this, she made the ensembles distinct by focusing on a single colour, each balancing Banrock Station's brand palette with current colour trends. LBB> Tell us more about the merch! What was the creation process like, and do you have a personal favourite piece?

You might be a sports team accused of using your brand image to cast a favourable light on the home country of a sponsor where the government has been accused of human rights abuses. You may be a popular retail brand pushing your sustainability credentials, but are your raw materials obtained from truly sustainable sources? At best these could be seen as a case â€“ common in large organisations â€“ of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. At worst, they are prime examples of pinkwashing, sportswashing and greenwashing aimed at covering up the organisation's ESG failings. Either way, they are a brand risk to businesses. Savvy and aware consumers may choose to avoid your brand or even accuse you on social media of hypocrisy. Increasingly inappropriate claims could potentially land you in hot water with regulators. How can businesses protect themselves? Read on to find out more. Evolving legislation, regulatory landscapes and industry focus These issues become all the more pertinent as we see regulators becoming increasingly active and alive to ESG issues, particularly around the S (social issues), as well as the E (environmental issues) that have historically been the focus. So too are we seeing further legislation in this space, with the EU's tandem set of legislation (CSRD and CS3D) requiring companies to identify potential negative impacts of their business on human rights and/or the environment. The G (governance) is the glue that binds these elements together and, arguably, may be lacking where a company is not joined up in terms of its practices and branding. In the UK, we have seen the Competitions and Markets Authority announce on 26 January 2023 that it will extend its scrutiny of misleading environmental claims in fashion to the fast-moving consumer goods sector, issuing specific environmental claims guidance and a green claims code too. On 25 May 2023, the Advertising Standards Authority updated its guidance to avoid racial and ethnic stereotyping in ads â€“ encouraging diversity of accents, food or cultural customs, but with ensuring those people are not the source of any jokes or used in a way that marks them out as other. Looking behind the marketing to protect your brands It seems clear then that firms should look behind the marketing to check that their own house is in order before making significant claims of support or alignment with a particular community or cause. Our top five tips: Understand the evolving legal landscape. Firms should get to grips with evolving rules from regulators like the CMA and industry bodies such as the ASA, as well as the incoming legislative updates in the EU, the UK and on the wider global stage. These bodies also have shifting focuses and priorities which sectors should be alive to. In considering your activities against these developments, it may be worth asking this question: would an individual with a grievance be able to use any of these developments against the business? Carry out due diligence on your supply chain. You need to understand not just what your own organisation is doing, but your whole supply chain, identifying suppliers and collaborators (including eg influencer marketeers), carrying out appropriate due diligence on their practices and activities, mitigating any adverse impacts and continually assessing these parties on an ongoing basis. Under CS3D, the due diligence requirements are likely to have a wider scope than supply chains in the narrow sense, and cover a range of downstream â€“ as well as upstream â€“ connections. Ensure you have appropriate whistleblowing policies, internal employment practices and grievance procedures. Ensuring staff feel empowered to speak up gives organisations more power to ensure that their external claims align with the internal feeling and practices in their own organisations. The ability for staff at all levels to know that they can safely blow the whistle reflects a shared responsibility and positive culture. The establishment of adequate grievance procedures is a key requirement of CS3D. Authentic representation and engagement with community and consistent support throughout the year. Make sure your support for social groups is not just for specific events like Pride Month or for International Women's Day. Do the work throughout the year and engage with local communities. While no organisation is perfect, a consistent and well thought-through approach across the business aligning with wider policies and practices should back-up statements and publicity. Equally each organisation will have different focuses, expertise and priorities which will make consistent authentic representation look different from brand to brand. For example, DLA Piper hasset up an LGBT+ pro bono unit, Iris Represents, connecting its LGBT+ staff and allies to LGBT+ NGOs and individuals in need of legal help throughout the year. Our Women in Sports group is also a great example of authentic engagement and support for gender equality in underrepresented areas. Engage all stakeholders. One of the common difficulties large organisations face is maintaining a consistent message across its stakeholders and ensuring transparent and joined up reporting lines. Develop policies and processes which cater for the above points but apply these across and listen to feedback from all business divisions and sectors. Ensure that the organisation has a transparent understanding of its practices, areas for development and controls.

(TSXV: GSTM) (FSE: B2U) (**Goldstorm** or **the Company**) is pleased to report the results from the final nine holes of the 2023 diamond drill exploration program (the **Program**) on its 100% owned Electrum gold - silver property (the **Property**), located within the Golden Triangle region of British Columbia, Canada. The Property is located immediately north of Scottie Resources' claims, and along a well-defined trend of former gold-silver producers that includes Ascot's Premier Mine to the south. The project area is road accessible from Stewart, BC. The Program at Electrum totaled 2,581 meters (m) in 11 drill holes that tested epithermal veins hosting precious and base-metal mineralization. **Ken Konkin P. Geo., President and CEO comments**; We are extremely pleased to announce the results from high-grade gold and silver intersections within sub-parallel polymetallic breccia and stockwork zones at our Electrum Project. The precious and base-metal mineralization encountered may be an extension to the bulk-tonnage Au-Ag veinlet system reported in our first Press Release dated October 4th, 2023. Our technical team believes that the hydrothermal veining may be related to an underlying porphyry system and that the high-grade components are possibly a late-stage event. We appear to have two distinct pulses of veining, the near-surface event is a silver-dominant lead-zinc system with minor gold while a deeper pulse is a gold-silver event. Given the success of these first set of drill holes at Electrum, we plan to return to these multi-phase targets with particular attention given to the larger bulk-tonnage gold-silver veinlet stockwork system encountered in the first two drill holes of the program, holes EZ-23-01 and EZ-23-02. We expect to build on the success of these holes and the high-grade gold-silver intercepts within EZ-23-08 and EZ-23-11 for the 2024 exploration season. In-addition, reconnaissance prospecting-mapping crews were equally successful in making significant precious and base-metal discoveries throughout the Crown Claim group northwest of the Electrum Property. News releases presenting these results will be forthcoming shortly, pending final assays. **Drill Hole Results** Click to view [plan map and cross sections](https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9214/187226_553072_2023-11-14_gstm-pr_ddh_sections.pdf). **Section A** **EZ-23-03:** Intersected 0.51 m of 1.29 g/t Au, 266.00 Ag, 3.14 % Pb, and 2.44 % Zn within 3.02 m of 0.73 g/t Au, 105.64 g/t Ag, 0.78 % Pb, 1.04 % Zn, at 4.98 m down hole in an epithermal-style quartz-sulphide vein. **EZ-23-04:** Intersected 3.05 m of 0.89 g/t Au, 125.31 g/t Ag, 0.48 % Pb, and 0.95 % Zn, at 6.20 m down hole, in the same epithermal vein seen in EZ-23-03. **EZ-23-05:** Intersected 1.90 m of 2.47 g/t Au, 126.00 g/t Ag, 0.36 % Pb, and 0.38 % Zn at 31.15 m down hole, in an epithermal vein. **EZ-23-06:** Intersected 0.65 m of 0.81 g/t Au, 44.66 g/t Ag, 0.57 % Pb, and 1.04 % Zn at 28.2 m down hole, in an epithermal vein. **EZ-23-07:** Intersected 1.55 g/t of 5.17 g/t Au, 68.02 g/t Ag, 0.32 % Pb, and 1.04 % Zn at 29.40 m down hole, in an epithermal vein. **Section B** **EZ-23-08:** Intersected 0.50 m 233.50 g/t Au and 756 g/t Ag within 4.50 m grading 27.00 g/t Au and 111.09 g/t Ag at 8.0 m down hole, in a series of epithermal veins.

Similar to the nearby Brucejack Mine, gold and silver mineralization occurs as coarse electrum in several generations of quartz-carbonate veins and vein breccias hosted within a deformed volcanic-sedimentary sequence. Intermediate-to-low sulphidation gold and silver mineralization is present in many of the veins, accompanied by pyrite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite. Precious metal mineralized veins have been traced on surface over lengths of several tens of meters to more than a hundred meters, pinching and swelling along strike. Much of the work at Electrum to date has tested extensions of known epithermal veins that have returned several high silver and gold values from limited underground mining and trench exposures. Drilling by previous operators encountered gold-silver mineralization at depths of more than 200 meters from surface with several holes intersecting relatively wide zones containing narrow quartz-sulfide stockwork veins that returned moderate precious metal values. These intercepts are located beneath surface exposures that were subsequently blasted, trenched and bulk sampled in an area referred to as the New Blast Zone in 2016 by Tudor Gold (2016 Assessment Report on the Electrum Property, Skeena M.D., BC.171029). Here, a 3.8 tonne bulk sample that was collected from a 5-meter-wide zone averaged 2.82 g/t gold, 539.0 g/t silver, 1.96 % lead and 1.97 % zinc. Localized veins, found within some of the wider drill intervals, contain electrum and silver sulfosalt minerals that have returned much higher silver and gold values over narrow widths.

(TSX: NCU) (OTC: NEVDF) (FSE: ZYTA) (Nevada Copper or the Company)** provides updates on recent operational developments at its Pumpkin Hollow underground mine (the **Underground Mine** ), including the first deliveries of concentrate in October 2023. ***Randy Buffington, President and CEO of Nevada Copper, stated*** , The mill has been able to process at nameplate capacity for certain periods exceeding expected recoveries on a number of occasions. With additional refinement, we expect to be achieving nameplate capacity consistently by the end of 2023 meeting all expected operating parameters. The team has worked tirelessly to get us to this point and I appreciate their dedication towards the restart and ramp up of the mine. ***Highlights of recent operational achievements include:*** * ***Mill commissioning progressing well*** â€“ Since the mill restart on October 3, 2023, commissioning activities have demonstrated that the mill can perform at nameplate capacity, with multiple shifts exceeding expected ramp-up capacity. The process team continues to make operational and mechanical improvements in preparation for the mill operating at nameplate capacity by the end of 2023. * ***Concentrate shipping in progress*** â€“ The first concentrate shipments started in October with approximately 446 dry metric tonnes shipped during the month. Concentrate quality shipped to date has met sales specifications. * ***First Geho pump online*** â€“ RAM Enterprise, Inc., a Nevada construction contractor, made significant progress on the life of mine de-watering system. One of the two Geho pumps is operational with the second expected to begin commissioning shortly. The de-watering system is expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2023 providing an additional 1,000 gallons per minute of dewatering capacity. * ***Underground development*** â€“ During Q3 2023, Small Mining Development continued to ramp-up lateral development, completing 3,366 feet, a 76% increase from the second quarter of 2023. With the assistance of development contractors, twelve ore stopes were fully developed with top and bottom lateral development completed and are now available for extraction once stope mining continues in the fourth quarter of 2023. Total available ore, including developed stopes, development tons, blasted inventory and surface stockpile is 442,089 tons. Ground conditions beyond the dike crossings are proving to be competent and consistent with the geotechnical model, which should enable conventional development and ground support. * ***Surface ore stockpile*** â€“ Approximately 84,364 tons of material was hoisted during Q3 2023, including approximately 62,277 tons of development ore and approximately 7,956 tons of stope ore. Ore stockpiled on surface at the end of Q3 2023 was estimated to be approximately 129,500 tons. ***Exploration*** As previously announced, the Company completed 2023 drill program with a total of 11 holes (3,305 feet) drilled on the Copper Ridge target and 9 holes (1,653 feet) on the Dimples target. Preliminary assays from the first two holes from the program have indicated that mineralization and alteration found at surface has been intersected in the drill holes. Final assays and QA/QC samples are expected to be received in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024. ***Board Changes*** The Company has appointed Anna Ladd-Kruger to the Board of Directors of Nevada Copper, effective November 20, 2023. ***Stephen Gill, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nevada Copper, stated*** , We are very pleased to have Anna join the Board, adding her operational and financial experience in base and precious metals companies. She has been an integral member of executive management for several companies that have grown from exploration and development to mid-tier producers, gaining key knowledge through all facets of the mining development cycle. She will add a strong strategic presence as we continue to ramp up Pumpkin Hollow and look towards future opportunities including the open pit. Ms. Ladd-Kruger has over 25 years of industry experience, progressing her career through financial and operational leadership roles at several Canadian publicly listed mining companies. She has experience in various stages of the mining process from exploration to multi-jurisdictional operations. Prior to retiring in 2022, Ms. Ladd-Kruger was the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of McEwen Mining Inc. where she was brought in to lead financial and operational turnaround strategies and was key to the McEwen Copper spin-out, including serving as its CFO and director. Ms. Ladd-Kruger previously served as the CFO and VP Corporate Development for a number of mining companies and began her career working at Vale S.A.'s Thompson and Sudbury Canadian operations before joining Kinross Gold Corporation as their North American Group Controller. Ms. Ladd-Kruger holds both a CPA and CMA designation, a Master's of Economics from Queen's University and a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of British Columbia. She also holds the Canadian Institute of Corporate Directors designation (ICD.D). Ms. Ladd-Kruger expected to join the Independent Committee and replace Mr. Lucio Genovese as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Mr. Genovese has indicated that he will step down from the Board of Directors effective November 20, 2023. Mr. Genovese has been a key member of the Board since May 2016. ***Stephen Gill, further stated,*** ** On behalf of the Board and management team, I thank Lucio for his efforts in building Nevada Copper from an early-stage development project to an operating company. We wish him well in his future endeavors. ***Outlook for the remainder of 2023*** Nevada Copper's principal objective for the remainder of 2023 is to have the Underground Mine operating at nameplate milling capacity of 5,000 tons per day by year end. To achieve that goal, several important milestones were achieved in October 2023. The mill was restarted on October 3, 2023, and milled over 48,000 tons of low-grade ore in October as part of the planned commissioning. Daily operating rates exceeded 3,000 tons per day over certain periods. Operations were impacted by periodic stoppages to address operating and maintenance conditions that are typically experienced in a commissioning phase. The plant achieved commissioning targets with copper recoveries averaging over 87% and demonstrated that copper concentrate can be produced within required specifications. Approximately 446 dry metric tonnes of concentrate were trucked to the rail transfer station in October as concentrate sales logistics were re-activated. As expected, a portion of concentrate production in the month was below specification grade and is expected to be blended with higher grade concentrate through November 2023 to upgrade it to specification prior to transport. Critical underground capital projects have progressed with the Geho life of mine dewatering project partially online as one of the pumps commissioned on November 12 and the second pump expected to begin commissioning later in November. Completion of this project doubles underground water pumping capacity. This project is expected to be fully on-line in November 2023. The underground crush and convey system completion has been delayed to January 2024, allowing RAM to focus their efforts on completion of the more critical Geho project as well as addressing delays in concrete pours due limited to underground access on certain levels. Three ore passes are in operation to mitigate ore and waste handling until the crushing system is commissioned.",positive,,EN,,,"6,5",UNKNOWN,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,N,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4tpxeoUljACyK7WNm2y9EBkgIq78LCVPIqlxt-B_MxA.jpg,307,r/Treaty_Creek,Then_Marionberry_259,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,92,0,0,P00,,,P

After a 17-3 lead from the visitors in the first quarter, the Chargers ramped things up, with QB Herbert (who went 27/40 for 323 yards, 4 TDs and an INT) and WR Allen (11 catches for 175 yards and 2 TDs) key factors to their resurgence. The home side were building momentum but the Lions (and QB Goff) refused to bow down, responding with a TD every time the Chargers got to the end zone. The offensive play calls (particularly on 4th downs) were bold and brilliant by both teams. The game was deciding by a Patterson 41 yard FG to give Detroit another impressive road win. Rookie CJ Stroud officially inked him myself into the MVP conversation with another heroic performance to take down Joe Burrow and the Bengals. Cinci in typical fashion started slowly and the Texans took fully advantage, going up 27-17 at the beginning of the 4th. Stroud got picked, giving the Bengals a lifeline, but he refused to let him derail him and his game-winning drive allowed kicker Ammendola to convert from 38 yards and seal the win. The Texans are now over .500 with Stroud ended the game with 364 TOT yard and 2 TOT yards, becoming the only QB in NFL to record: 2,500 yards, 15+ TD with 5 or fewer INTs in their first 9 games, a remarkable start from the No. 2 overall pick. #Flos #Sports #AmericanFootball #Football #NFL #Chiefs #Eagles #Broncos #Afc #Nfc #NFLDraft ",positive,,EN,,,"6,5",UNKNOWN,4,9,0,9,0,0,0,N,,https://extreme-img-rep.web-live.it/storage/2023/11/15/D2068674B3598A03EAA977D0EE543D167D5F7BFB77E9B043866AFB6975D61104.jpg,424,floslivesports,floslivesports{53955359417},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,57,0,0,P00,,,P

Crown Attorney Fraser Ball has started his closing remarks in the ongoing terrorism trial happening in Windsor, Ont. 'A heavily biased expert is no expert at all': Prosecutor asks jury to dismiss key defence witness in terrorism trial of London man WARNING: The video and the details in this article may be disturbing to some viewers Crown Attorney Fraser Ball has started his closing remarks in the ongoing terrorism trial happening in Windsor, Ont. Nathaniel Veltman, 22, has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in the June 6, 2021 attack on the Afzaal family in London, Ont. Four members of their family died and fifth family member was injured â€“ a boy who was nine years old at the time â€“ after they were struck by a pickup truck which Veltman has admitted at trial to driving. You have it all, Ball told the jury. Everything you could possibly need to convict in this case. Ball detailed the list; eyewitnesses to the murders, video capturing the murder, the murder weapon (the truck), DNA (evidence), data from the truck, photographs from the scene, a 9-1-1 call, Veltmans' manifesto, and a full confession. Nathaniel Veltmans' testimony: Veltman testified for eight days at trial, during which he told the jury about his difficult upbringing by a strict religious mother, his history of mental illness and declining mental health during the pandemic. Mr. Veltman can change his story now but he cannot change the facts. These facts are very unfriendly to Mr. Veltman, Assistant Crown Attorney Fraser Ball told the jury Tuesday afternoon. Ball asked the jury to dismiss Veltmans' assertion that he tried to steer away from the family at the last second because the truck data and eyewitness accounts do not support it. Veltman drove, Fast, no brakes, [with] intentional steering right into and through an innocent family, Ball said to the jury, calling his driving precise, lethal and intentional. Ball asked the jury to consider if Veltman had indeed wanted to change his mind at the last second, he wouldn't have struck the family, or he would have stopped on impact. Mr. Veltman was completely aware of the consequences of his actions, Ball said. Ball replayed the 9-1-1 call made by a cab driver, during which the jury can hear Veltman interject, saying, It was me, I did it on purpose. He told the jury to consider if those were the words of a person who is detached from reality or depersonalized. Veltman manifesto: One piece of the evidence towards terrorism is a manifesto written by Veltman called â€˜A White Awakening.' Ball noted Veltmans' manifesto was easily uncovered by police on a USB drive that was left out in the open in his apartment and it was not password protected. It is a hate-filled and lengthy document outlining Veltmans' extreme views towards Muslims. Nathaniel Veltman had a message for Muslims. It was strong. It was brutal. It was terrifying. 'Leave this country or you and your loved ones could be next,' Ball told the jury. The manifesto starts with an apology to his readers for rambling on. Ball questioned why he would do so if it wasn't meant to be shared at some point. He spent months in planning this very thing motivated by extreme racism and his desire to commit a terrorist attack, his desire to motivate others as he had been motivated by others to act, Ball said. Ball asked the jury to consider why Veltman would purchase a heavily financed pickup truck he couldn't afford, and then pay for tinted windows and a push bar installed on the front just weeks before the attack. He also had to purchase a bulletproof vest and helmet online. Mr Veltman was buying all the tools he needed, Ball said. When he left his apartment, Veltman was wearing cargo pants, steel toed boots, and a white t-shirt with a cross spray-painted on it. These are work clothes the defence will have you believe, Ball said to the jury. These were warrior clothes the evidence shows. Forensic psychiatrist evidence: The crown wants the jury to give no weight to the evidence presented by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Julian Gojer, who was called by the defence. Over the course of several days of testimony, Dr. Gojer told the jury he diagnosed Veltman with multiple mental illnesses, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, complex trauma, and personality disorder. He further testified at the time of the attack, Veltman was suffering from what the doctor refers to as â€˜adverse effects' or â€˜rebound effects' of withdrawal from psilocybin â€“ commonly known as magic mushrooms - which Veltman consumed approximately 40 hours before the attack. The Crowns' position is that Dr. Gojer was not impartial at all, Ball told the jury, highlighting three reasons why the jury should be deeply troubled by his evidence: The crown said it's based almost entirely on Veltman's self-reporting to the doctor The evidence about â€˜adverse effects' of psilocybin is an educated guess according to Ball and is supported by one online survey and a Sept. 2023 appointment with Veltman after the trial started The crown alleges the doctor did not provide an unbiased perspective to the court and did not take all information into account when writing his report and testifying at trial A heavily biased expert is no expert at all, Ball said to the jury. Ball will continue his closing arguments Wednesday morning in Superior court.

Supreme Court: There is a compelling need for expeditious disposal of cases on elected representatives; issues guidelines to High Courts regarding the same. The Supreme Court, in Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay vs. Union of India & Anr ., issued guidelines to the High Courts across the country for deciding on cases against elected representatives. It remarked that these cases have a direct bearing on political democracy, and it is necessary to ensure that these cases are decided on priority and expeditiously. A three-judge bench of the apex court comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice JB Pardiwala, and Justice Manoj Misra were hearing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution seeking expeditious disposal of criminal cases against elected representatives of Parliament and legislative assemblies. The apex court, in Public Interest Foundation vs. Union of India directed that the trial shall be concluded as speedily and expeditiously as may be possible and in no case later than one year from the date of the framing of charges. In the earlier stages of this case, the apex court called upon the Union Government, State Governments and High Courts to respond to the idea of setting up special courts and the financial implications involved in its implementation, based on the submission by the Solicitor General. After looking at the complexity, the court suggested that instead of setting up special courts, a specified court in each district, both at the sessions and magistrate level, be identified and earmarked for prioritized hearings of the subject cases. It asked the Governments to respond to this suggestion. The apex court directed the High Courts to examine and constitute as many sessions and magisterial courts as possible for speedy disposal of cases, in the below priority order. Offences punishable with death/life against sitting and former MPs/MLAs Offences punishable with imprisonment up to 5 years or more Rest of the offences Further, looking at the data, it is seen that there are as many as 5,175 subject cases pending as of November 2022. Of these, cases that are pending for more than 5 years are as many as 2,116 or more than 40% of such pendency. Looking at the data and information available, the apex court remarked that there are various factors that could influence the progress of the cases, and it becomes difficult to issue uniform guidelines for all states. Accordingly, the apex court left it to the High Courts to decide on the methods/measures that they think are relevant for expeditious disposal of cases. The court issued certain guidelines regarding the same. Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of. Supreme Court: Inquires in sexual harassment cases must be done keeping in mind broader possibilities and entire background of the case. The Supreme Court, in Union of India & Ors. vs. Dilip Paul , held that courts must be cognizant to not get swayed away by the hyper technicalities and procedural deficiencies, but rather focus on the impact of the violation of such procedures on the inquiry. This case involves a complaint of sexual harassment filed by a female employee against the respondent. The female employee filed an initial complaint of sexual harassment against the respondent. The complainant submitted a second complaint with additional allegations against the respondent. Two initial inquiries, a fact-finding inquiry, and a Frontier Complaints Committee inquiry, failed to substantiate the allegations. The Ministry of Home Affairs constituted the Central Complaints Committee to investigate the matter. This committee found the respondent guilty of sexual harassment. The respondent claimed that the allegations were false and were made because he had rejected the transfer application of the complainant. The respondent approached the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) seeking the cancellation of the Central Complaints Committee's inquiry. CAT refrained from expressing an opinion as the disciplinary proceedings were still pending. The case moved to the High Court, which ruled that the Central Complaints Committee had overstepped its jurisdiction by considering the second complaint. The High Court stated that the committee's role was limited to the first complaint, and it should not have considered the allegations in the second complaint. The High Court found that the Central Complaints Committee had taken on a prosecutorial role during the inquiry and that its jurisdiction was limited to the first complaint. The High Court also criticized the committee's findings, characterizing the case as No Evidence. This is challenged before the Supreme Court. The Apex court looked at the arguments from both sides. It framed four questions as below. On the first question, the apex court held that when it comes to disciplinary proceedings, the inquiry authority and disciplinary authority in the exercise of their powers of judicial review should not sit in appeal and reappreciate the evidence or substitute its own findings. Regarding how courts should approach such cases, the apex court cautioned the courts of getting swayed away by procedural deficiencies and held that courts are obliged to rely on any evidence of the complainant that inspires confidence. The apex court in various other judgements remarked that all material that is logically probative to a prudent mind ought to be permissible in disciplinary proceedings keeping in mind the principles of fair play, as there is a power imbalance in sexual harassment cases. The court found the High Court's reasoning that the Central Complaints Committee was constituted on the basis of the first complaint, and therefore its scope is limited as erroneous, as the constitution of the committee was based on a prior standing order and not just the complaint. On the question of the Central Complaints Committee questioning the witnesses, the apex court wondered how the complaints committee after being equated with a judge in a judicial proceeding is denied such privilege. The primary objective is to unearth all the facts relevant to the case and provide ample opportunities for all stakeholders keeping in mind the principles of natural justice. On the question of the case being an example of a case with â€˜no-evidence', the apex court remarked that the material on record reasonably substantiates the allegations of sexual harassment levelled by the complainant. It was not considered by the High Court as it was limited by the scope of judicial review. Non-availability of call records as material evidence was rightly noted by the Committee since there is a significant time lapse in the complainant registering a complaint. Hence, this is not a case of â€˜no evidence'. Based on the conclusions derived, the apex court held that the High Court committed an egregious error in passing the impugned judgment and order. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

Consider loose fitting and cotton clothes. â™¨ï¸ KEEP WARM: Make sure you wear appropriate winter clothing. ðŸ’Š VITAMIN D: Vitamin D maintains a healthy body and immune system. It's formed through exposure to the sunlight. Winter means there's less sunlight so the risk of deficiency is higher. â„ï¸ AVOID ICY PATCHES: Beware of icy patches on the road. Comfortable and adapted shoes are needed to avoid slipping/falling. Reference: NCT (National Childbirth Trust) (2023).

I just rewrote the flash back part which would include more characters and a strong motivation for Leo to leave Das & Co to leave a peaceful life. Leo and his sister Elisa are very close. They do all the illegal stuff together. Rolex is their business partner, who doesn't trust anyone. Even though they behave like they are close, both gangs are suspicious of each other. Unknown to everyone Elisa is the mole that has been working with Inspector Bejoy (Narain from Kaithi and Vikram) during the beginning days of his career. Both the organisations, Das and Rolex are looking really hard for the mole who has been causing significant damage to their businesses. Elisa wants the leave the business and have a normal life like every other girl. She confides her thoughts with her brother when they are driving back from a drop-off. Rolex comes to know that Elisa is the mole. He asks everyone in both gangs to assemble at their warehouse. Rolex asks Leo what will he do to the mole when he reveals the mole's name to everyone. Leo says that he would kill the mole and takes the responsibility of killing the mole. Unknown to Leo, Rolex has already informed Harold Das about Elisa. Rolex reveals the name in a dramatic fashion and asks Leo to kill his sister. He leaves the Warehouse predicting Leo's actions and not to get in the crossfire. Now Leo is conflicted about what to do. He acts like he is about to kill Elisa and tries to save her by starting a fight with his own gang. Harold predicting that Leo would do this, kills Elisa. During this fight, Leo fakes his death. Deeply hurt by the loss of his sister, to live life as his sister has dreamt of, he gives up his violent past behind.

It was a busy day, getting there early on Thursday and staying on into the evening for some events. Highlights (beyond the incredible weather) were the talks at @domustiles and @havwoods ; discussions and helpful meetings at @solusceramics @modusdesignstudio_ , @raaftglobal and @idealstandardofficial and a workshop at @rockfon_official . They toured the showrooms and design studios picking up some useful trade literature and contacts. Thanks to the staff at each showroom for their enthusiasm and introduction to what is an amazing collection of spaces and resources. We took some photos of the spaces and are aiming to bring clients across from â€˜out west' to the London design district! @londondesigndistrict #architectural #architecture #design #architect #architecturephotography #architecturelovers #architecturedesign #archilovers #art #interior #architects #archdaily #building #construction #architectureporn #homedecoration #homecounties #londonarchitects #architectureinspiration #design #designideas #architectskew #richmondarchitects #lighting #interiorpaint #exteriorpaint #interiordesign #furniture #materials #clerkenwelldesignweek ",positive,,EN,,,"5,5",UNKNOWN,6,31,0,29,0,2,0,N,,https://extreme-img-rep.web-live.it/storage/2023/11/15/12940C2ECC75DB2DABAB6F127C551C33BC63E2543673A3608F86CCA1BDA81095.jpg,0,50degreesnortharchitects,50degreesnortharchitects{3505661068},0,0,0,0,0,0,,,124,0,0,P00,,,P
