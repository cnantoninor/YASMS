Toby Rowland.. Oklahoma baseball rewind: A recap of the Sooners' weekend from the pitchers' perspective with commentary from the radio voice of the Sooners. Toby Rowland. | Feb 26, 2024. NATHAN J. FISH/THE OKLAHOMAN / USA TODAY. Editor's note: This is part of a regular standing feature by staff contributor Cameron Black, who will be providing a weekly column during the 2024 Oklahoma baseball season recapping the Sooners' weekend activity on the diamond. The focus will be from the perspective of the pitching staff, hence the standing headline "Monday Mound Visit.". The Sooners returned to the friendly confines of L Dale Mitchell Park for their home opener this weekend, a four-game series against Wright State.. This is the first time in program history that Wright State and the Sooners have faced off against each other on the baseball diamond, and it was commemorated with 3 days of offensive fireworks.. Wright State travelled to Norman with a 1-2 season record, and the Sooners entered the weekend series with a 2-2 record.. By the time the four-game series wrapped up Sunday evening, the Sooners had improved to 5-3, while the visitors headed home to Fairborn, Ohio, with a record of 2-5.. Let's take a walk out to the mound and see how the Sooners pitching staff performed during this series.. Game 1: Friday, February 23. Oklahoma 20, Wright State 0. Junior left-hander Braden Davis received the start for the Sooners, taking the mound and not giving it up for six scoreless innings. Davis gave up no runs on three hits on 92 pitches. He did yield a free pass on a walk but struck out a career-high eight batters.. Senior righty Jett Lodes entered the game in the seventh inning in relief of Davis and worked the next two innings. He was near perfect allowing just one hit, striking out four and walking one on 32 pitches.. Myles Meyer, a junior transfer from American River College in California, worked the eighth inning, giving up one hit along with a strikeout and a walk. Freshman right-hander Brad Pruett closed out the game for Oklahoma, retiring the three batters he faces and striking out two of them.. Four Sooner pitchers combined for no runs on five hits and 15 strikeouts. The starter Davis picked up the win, his first of the season without a loss.. Thanks to a shutout performance by the Sooners pitching staff, and an offensive explosion, producing 20 runs on 21 hits, including a couple of home runs (solo shots by Anthony Mackenzie and Scott Mudler in the 7th) by the Sooner bats, the Sooners easily took game in the series.. Game 2 : Saturday, February 24 (game one of a doubleheader). Oklahoma 14, Wright State 9. Right-handed starter Brendan Girton, a junior transfer from Texas Tech, drew the starting assignment in the first game of a doubleheader on Saturday afternoon. Girton worked the first 3.2 innings. He allowed five runs (only one earned) on six hits, struck out two and walked two. He also was charged with a wild pitch and hit a batter.. Junior southpaw Jace Miner followed Girton to the mound. Miner worked the next two innings in relief. During his appearance, Minor gave up a couple of runs on two hits on 28 pitches.. Three more Sooners took the mound in relief in game one of the twin bill. Senior Carson Atwood came in to work two-thirds of an inning and recorded one out in the seventh before giving way to senior Grant Stevens , a redshirt-senior transfer from University of the Pacific. Atwood's line for the game was one run on no hits and a walk. Stevens worked 1.1 innings, allowing one run on one hit and a walk. in relief would take the mound next, allowing one run on no hits, a walk and no strike outs through 14 pitches.. Malachi Witherspoon closed it out for the Sooners, working the final 1.1 innings. The right-handed reliever surrendering no runs, no hits and struck out two.. For the game, five Sooner pitchers made appearances, giving up nine runs on nine hits while striking out nine and walking four. Minor (1-1) picked up the win in relief.. Game 3: Saturday, February 24 (Game 2 of a doubleheader). Oklahoma 10, Wright State 3. Kyson Witherspoon , brother of Malachi, was the starter for OU in the nightcap of Saturday's doubleheader. Both brothers transferred in the offseason from Northwest Florida State College. Kyson worked 5.0 innings and earned the win, his first of the season. The right-hander allowed two runs on seven hits, struck out three and walked three.. Junior Reid Hensley, who throws from the right side followed Witherspoon to the mound, working 1.1 innings, giving up a run on no hits and striking out two of the four batters he faced.. Redshirt senior Carter Campbell finished out the game for Oklahoma. Campell threw 54 pitches in 2.2 innings, working the 6h, 7th and 8thand allowing no runs and no hits, walking three and fanning four on 54 pitches.. The Sooners' pitching staff held the Wright State Raiders to three runs in Game 2 of the Saturday doubleheader, giving up seven hits, striking out nine and walking six.. Game 4: Sunday, February 25. Wright State 12, Oklahoma 2. All good things must come to an end, and the Sooners dropped the series finale to the Raiders but still walked away from the weekend with the series win.. Senior lefty James Hitt take Sunday game starter. Hitt battled through just 2.1 innings, throwing 60 pitches and surrendering six runs on eight hits. He didn't walk anybody and did strike out three hitters before giving way to the bullpen with one down in the third inning.. Will Carston took over after Hitt's rough outing and worked two innings, allowing three runs on three hits and yielding three walks.. Four more OU pitchers saw action in the game. Carson Atwood, Jett Lodes, Dylan Crooks and Ryan Lambert worked the final 4.2 innings with Crooks working the longest stint (2.0 innings). The four relievers combined for a stat line of 4.2 innings pitched, three runs allowed on four hits. two strikeouts, one walk and a hit batter. The loss went to the starter Hitt (0-1).. On a day when the Sooners red-hot bats seemed to cool off, and the pitching staff struggled mightily, the final totals for Sunday's series finale were 12 runs on 15 hits (11 earned), walking four with only five strikeouts.. Talk With T-Row. Commentary from the radio voice of the Sooners, Toby Rowland. Braden Davis was sensational on Friday night for the Sooners, but other than him, it felt like a step backwards this weekend for OU pitching. Despite record-setting opening weekend crowds and winning three-out-of-four against a Wright State team that has been to three consecutive NCAA Tournaments, Sooner pitching underwhelmed.. Brendan Girton and Jamie Hitt were both less effective than in their opening starts in Arlington. And Kyson Witherspoon in his first OU start looked less dominant as well. Sunday was one of those days where no matter who took the mound for Skip Johnson, the visitors found their offensive rhythm.. Eight games in 10 days to start the season is ambitious. The Sooners had to use a lot of pitching to get through that opening stretch. A few days rest now before heading out to Las Vegas may do them some good.". Upcoming. This weekend the Sooners will travel to Las Vegas for the College Baseball Classic, where they will match up against Pittsburgh on Friday, California on Saturday and Ohio State on Sunday..

K92 Mining Inc. has announced the results of the first two drill holes completed from its maiden drill program near Arakompa at the Kainantu Gold Mine in Eastern Highlands Province. Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window). K92 Mining Inc. has announced the results of the first two drill holes completed from its maiden drill program near Arakompa at the Kainantu Gold Mine in Eastern Highlands Province.. Arakompa is near infrastructure, located approximately 4.5km south-east of the Kainantu Gold Mine's processing plant, and closer to the process plant than the producing Kora and Judd vein systems, located approximately 3km south-west of Arakompa.. K92's recently completed hole KARDD0002 is the longest hole drilled in the history of the project.. It intersects significant mineralisation including four lodes recording 7.20m at 24.76 g/t AuEq (3.46 m true thickness), 5.70 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq (2.74 m true thickness), 5.30m at. 6.06 g/t AuEq (2.92 m true thickness) and 3.60 m at 3.37 g/t AuEq (1.73 m true thickness).. One of the lodes, intersecting 5.70 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq, recorded significant chalcopyrite and bornite mineralization, with the copper component grading 1.7 per cent.. High grade lode mineralization appears to have significant similarities to Kora and Judd K92 chief executive officer (CEO) and director John Lewins said: "We are very excited to be announcing the first two drill hole results from Arakompa, demonstrating very high potential from both the multiple intersections and significant size potential from surface sampling, drill holes and local workings covering a strike of 1.7 km, a mineralised corridor of approximately 150 to 225 metres wide, and a demonstrated vertical extent of over 500 metres.. "Arakompa is also near infrastructure, located closer to the process plant than Kora and Judd, with relatively gradual terrain for road access up from the Markham Valley, and importantly, represents a highly prospective opportunity to potentially grow production at Kainantu beyond the Stage 4 Expansion.. "Plans have already been actioned to expand the program at Arakompa in the near-term.". K92 executive vice president exploration Chris Muller stated: "The Arakompa project represents another vein system analogous to the Kora-Judd consolidated corridor, with just as much potential.. In addition to the high-grade massive sulphide veins, the intervening gold mineralisation at Arakompa is well developed and intimately associated with widespread phyllic alteration likely representing the upper expressions of a fertile porphyry at depth.". "Almost all of the 18 holes drilled by former operators, Renison Goldfields Consolidated Limited and Highlands Gold Limited, intersected excellent gold-rich intercepts, even with only 1,766 metres drilled historically.. "Though drill tested over a substantial strike length, drilling by these companies only tested the very shallow parts of the veins. Clear indications of the vein system at surface, around 1000m RL, are a testament to even greater strike potential to the north and exceptional depth extent as well.. "The proximity of the Arakompa mineralized corridor to the Kainantu Gold Mine infrastructure, even closer to the Lae-Madang Highway than Kora, is a significant attribute and will enable a major drilling campaign to be carried out cost effectively.. "We look forward to working with our stakeholders to delineate potentially the next major resource for Papua New Guinea.".  	0

The Canberra vacancy rate is projected by JLL to trend upward over 2024, driven by the completion of new office stock (totalling 72,700 sqm).  Canberra to see 72,700sqm of new office stock in 2024. Analysts expect tenants to relocate from the older offices to the newer buildings.. The Canberra vacancy rate is projected by JLL to trend upward over 2024, driven by the completion of new office stock (totalling 72,700 sqm).. Newer office buildings in the market are expected to lease well, and it is expected that tenants will relocate out of older-style office accommodations, which could be earmarked for withdrawal and repositioning.. Here's more from JLL:. Further yield softening is expected over the next 12 months. The yield spread between prime and secondary assets is expected to widen. In particular, older-style secondary grade assets are likely to have elevated vacancy risk, which will be priced accordingly.. Small tenants support demand. Canberra recorded positive net absorption of approximately 1,500 sqm over Q4 2023, mainly driven by small tenant (<1,000 sqm) leasing activity.. As a result of the positive demand, the Canberra headline vacancy rate decreased 0.2 percentage points (ppts) to 7.8% over Q4 2023. The prime grade vacancy rate decreased by 0.8 ppts to 5.8% over the quarter. The secondary grade vacancy decreased by 0.4 ppts to 11.7% over the quarter.. Completions over 2023 well below long-term trend. We recorded no completions and one withdrawal (totalling 3,072 sqm) in the Canberra office market. There is currently 2.2 million sqm of total stock as at Q4 2023. We recorded 13,000 sqm of completions over 2023, well below the 20-year average of 66,100 sqm. There is currently 100,600 sqm of stock under construction in Canberra with completion dates between 2024 to 2026.. The largest project under construction is 15 Sydney Avenue (35,000 sqm) which is scheduled for completion in Q2 2026. The asset is fully pre-committed by the Australian Taxation Office. The second largest project under construction is 1 City Hill (33,000 sqm), which is scheduled for completion in Q1 2024.. Prime yield softens due to elevated cost of debt. Prime net effective rents marginally decreased 0.2% over the quarter and have decreased by 2.8% over the past year. Prime face rents have continued to grow over the past year (1.0%), which has been offset by an uplift in incentives to 25.6%. Secondary net effective rents decreased 1.8% over the quarter, driven by an uplift in incentives.. Prime yields in Canberra softened 50 bps on the upper end and 25 bps on the lower end to range between 6.00%-7.50%. The softening reflects a shift in investor sentiment because of the elevated cost-of-debt environment and global macroeconomic uncertainty.. . Note: Canberra Office refers to Canberra's office market (all grades).. .  	0
