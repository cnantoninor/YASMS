He doubted that any dragon would dare to enter Doomwing's territory uninvited, but it was still a relief to know that they weren't in any danger. The Stalwart Guard had many weapons, but none that could contend with a dragon a mile long.. ""So… this is the place you have chosen?"" Doomwing asked. The dragon had chosen to remain airborne rather than rest his weight upon the twin peaks that Harald had chosen for his people. His eyes gleamed. ""An excellent location."". ""Is it?"" Harald asked, fishing for information. His eldest son had used every method at his disposal to examine this area, and Harald had done the same. However, if he could glean any additional information from Doomwing, then so much the better.. Doomwing chuckled, and Harald knew that the dragon understood what he was trying to do. Rather than being offended, he seemed amused by the attempt. ""There are multiple rich veins of minerals in these mountains and the surrounding area."" Harald saw a glimmer of something in the air beside Doomwing. ""Hmm… gold, iron, copper, silver, along with a host of more… exotic minerals. You and your kin could mine for millennia and never exhaust the wealth here. Moreover, this place sits atop a wellspring of power. You should have no problems recharging the crystals that power the Stalwart Guard."". Harald tried and failed to keep himself from grinning like a fool. So much wealth, and Doomwing was just letting them have it? Well, not have it. They would have to pay tribute, but the dragon's terms were reasonable. If anything, he seemed more interested in developing their expertise than in simply filling his hoard with even more precious metals.. ""What did you do just now?"" Harald asked. ""I saw something flash in the air beside you."". ""Oh?"" Doomwing leaned forward, and Harald fought the instinctive urge to scream when the massive reptile closed the distance in a single swift, sinuous movement. Nothing that big should move so quickly or gracefully. ""What did you see?"". ""It's hard to say."" Harald pursed his lips. ""It looked almost like writing."". The dragon grinned, baring those big, big teeth of his. ""Impressive. That was a greater rune of scrying designed to reveal and catalogue the contents of the earth. That you were able to catch even a glimpse of it speaks well of you."". ""A greater rune?"" Harald's eyes widened in shock. ""Do you speak of the words that bind the world?"". ""Is that what you call them?"" Doomwing eased away. ""That name is a bit misleading, but runes are indeed capable of incredible things. Only the greatest heroes of your people have ever been able to wield greater runes. Still, you were able to glimpse a fraction of it, which means you might be able to learn something less powerful."". Another symbol appeared in the air beside Doomwing.. ""Can you see that?"" Doomwing asked.. Harald barely heard him. Instead, his gaze was locked onto the symbol floating in the air beside Doomwing. It was almost impossible to describe, at once infinitely simple yet immeasurably complex, its shape seeming to bleed out of the world and into higher and lower planes of existence.. ""Yes, you can definitely see it."" Doomwing chuckled. ""You might not have Antaria's raw power, but you do have a lot more experience in using the power you do have. Take your magic and try to twist it into the shape of what you see."". Harald nodded quickly and did as Doomwing asked. He failed a few times, and each time, he spat blood, but on his fourth attempt, his magic finally took on the shape he wanted. The symbol snapped into place in front of him, and his reserves of magic rushed to fill it. At once, knowledge poured into his mind.. He knew what was in the ground beneath his feet. He knew how the veins of gold twisted and turned within the slope and how veins of silver and other minerals traced whimsical paths around it. Lodes of crystals and gemstones revealed themselves and –. The vision stopped, and he just barely stayed on his feet.. ""What did you see?"" Doomwing asked.. ""I saw into the mountain,"" Harald wiped sweat off his brow and reached for the gourd of water at his waist. ""What… what was that?"". ""A basic rune of prospecting. It is amongst the weakest that I know."". ""That was one of the weakest?"" Harald gaped. ""I thought the magic you taught us earlier was potent, but that… that was far stronger!"". ""Runes are far beyond the ordered spells that you are accustomed to. They can change the story of the world… or allow you to read it."" Doomwing chuckled. ""You will find that rune very useful in the days ahead. Keep it to yourself… although, if any of your children can learn it, let me know. You are too old now for the training I have in mind, but your children might still be young enough to go through it."". ""You would offer them personal training?"" Harald asked.. ""If they have the potential, yes."" Doomwing's smile was somehow cold and warm at the same time. ""But that is a matter for another day. Suffice it to say that my training will be difficult but rewarding."" He grinned again, almost feline despite his shadow covering the mountain. ""You should ask the princess about it the next time you see her."". ""I shall,"" Harald vowed. The rune still shone in his mind. He would let no one other than his children know about it. It was simply too valuable to be shared lightly, and yet Doomwing had said it was amongst the least of his runes. ""Your more powerful runes… what could they do?"". ""If I wished, I could turn this mountain to powder and rip free all of value within it,"" Doomwing said. ""But I have little reason to do that. I wish for your people to grow and develop, and you will never progress if I do everything for you."" The dragon looked into the distance. ""If you and your people work hard, then one day, the Stalwart Guard will not sail the skies alone."". ""That is a fine thought,"" Harald said quietly. ""A very fine thought indeed."". ""But you are certain of your choice?"" Doomwing asked. ""There are other places of great wealth in this area."". ""Aye,"" Harald said. ""I've thought about it, and this place has everything we need. It has wealth, but it also isn't too far into the mountains and foothills. You did mention earlier that you wanted us to work with the humans you have. These peaks also have a commanding view of the surrounding area, so we'll never be caught off guard, and they seem quite defensible too. We could build twin fortresses here, and I doubt anyone short of a dragon would ever be able to threaten us."". ""I could help with that,"" Doomwing said.. Harald chuckled and shook his head. ""No. We'll manage. If this is to be our new home, then we want to carve it out of the mountain with our own hands."". The dragon nodded. There was respect in his gaze. ""Then it seems you've made your decision."" He turned. ""You already know how to reach me if you need aid. I have matters to attend to in my volcano."". ""Thank you,"" Harald said. ""When I went into exile, I never thought I would find a place for myself like this."". ""You are welcome,"" Doomwing replied before he stopped and turned back. ""I should probably mention that one of my fellow dragons has awakened in the Sky Claw Mountains."". Harald froze. ""What?"". ""Yes. A fellow primordial dragon, Ashheart. I encased him in a mountain at the end of the Fifth Age to help him heal. He just recently awakened. I imagine your brother must be aware of him by now since he likely destroyed the mountain he was in while awakening."". Harald stumbled back, heart pounding in his chest. ""Is… are…?"". ""Are your kin in any danger?"" Doomwing laughed, and the sound of it shook ",0

Magnetic Resources NL. Overview. Magnetic Resources (ASX: MAU ) is an Australian company, developing a portfolio of significant gold projects in the established mining province, Laverton region, in Western Australia.. The company owns a 100-percent interest in the Hawks Nest and Lady Julie projects in Laverton, the Homeward Bound South project in Leonora, and the Benjabbering project in Julimar. The main deposits include Hawks Nest 9 (HN9), Lady Julie Central (LJC), Lady Julie North 4 (LJN4), Mount Jumbo and Homeward Bound South, which are all located in an area with well-endowed regional infrastructure, including three processing plants within 10 to 35 kilometres. These plants are owned by well-known operators including Goldfields Genesis/Dacian; Anglo-Ashanti; and Genesis/Dacian.. The projects' proximity to these existing processing facilities gives enough options to MAU for toll processing without having to invest millions of dollars in constructing its own processing plant.. Several large deposits such as Wallaby, Sunrise Dam and Jupiter Gold are in this jurisdiction. The company's projects are adjacent to some of these world-class deposits. The Mt Jumbo and Hawks Nest tenements are only 15 kilometres north of the Wallaby deposit. At both HN9 and Lady Julie, Magnetic Resources had identified multiple thickened stacked lodes near-surface, which have some similarities to Wallaby and Sunrise Dam.. LJN4, a key focus for the Laverton project, hosts thick breccia and silica pyrite zones up to 50 metres thick, which are also prevalent in Anglo Ashanti's world-class Sunrise Dam deposit, both parallel to near-surface breccia zones and vertical mineralization going downwards into several of their deposits. The Mau breccia zones often carry higher grades and are now being extended by new drilling at depth and further to the east and northeast, potentially growing the LJN4 resource.. In November 2023, the company announced a significant increase in the mineral resource estimates. The deposits in the Laverton and Homeward Bound area have seen a significant 107-percent increase over the last report in February 2023. The updated combined mineral resources estimate for the whole project area stands at 22.7 million tonnes (Mt) @ 1.69 grams per ton (g/t) gold totaling 1.24 million ounces (Moz) of gold at 0.5 g/t cutoff.. LJN4 is now, by far, the largest resource in the project area, as its contained gold rose from 204,000 oz to 852,000 oz, a 317-percent increase. Extension drilling continues and is expected to result in further resource increases.. The significance of LJN4's gold resource has not gone unnoticed, as research firm Argonaut has called it a ‘ sleeping giant ,' noting recent drilling at LJN4 ""indicates a significant discovery unfolding in the Laverton region."" If MAU can replicate the recent drilling intercepts, the next resource update at LNJ4 could easily make it a 1-Moz deposit. This will position LJN4 as one of the best undeveloped gold assets in the Laverton region.. Company Highlights. Magnetic Resources (MAU) is an Australian company focused on gold development projects in Western Australia.. The company owns a 100-percent-interest in the Hawks Nest and Lady Julie projects in Laverton, the Homeward Bound South project in Leonora, and the Benjabbering project in Julimar.. MAU's large tenement positions in the Leonora and Laverton districts of Western Australia, are near numerous large deposits with existing mining operations and good infrastructure.. The presence of three processing plants close to MAU's Laverton deposits provides scope for toll processing.. In November 2023, the company announced a 107-percent increase in the resource estimate for Laverton and Homeward Bound South deposits. The revised resource stands at 22.7 Mt @ 1.69 g/t gold totaling 1.24 Moz of gold at 0.5 g/t cutoff.. For the Laverton project deposits - Lady Julie North 4,Lady Julie Central and Hawks Nest 9 - early work programs, including project environmental, heritage and technical background studies, are close to completion. The aim is to submit a mining proposal in January 2024.. In October 2023, the company announced the completion of a AU$4.8-million private placement . The company is now fully funded with AU$7 million cash to aggressively advance to the next stage of development.. The company's highly experienced senior leadership team has a proven track record to capitalize on the high resource potential of its projects.. Key Projects. Laverton Projects. MAU has 179 sq. kilometres. of prospective exploration tenements in the Laverton region comprising three main deposits - Hawks Nest 9 (HN9), Lady Julie Central (LJC) and Lady Julie North 4 (LJN4). All are 100-percent-owned tenements and within 20 to 30 kilometres of three major gold camps collectively hosting more than 25 Moz of gold resource - Granny Smith (owned by Goldfields Australia), Jupiter (owned by Dacian Gold) and Sunrise Dam (owned by AngloGold Ashanti). In the Laverton Project, extensive drilling programs have been completed with 1,898 RC/DD holes for 147,943 metres with further deeper drilling now planned.. MAU's updated resource estimate stands at 10.4 Mt indicated @ 1.74 g/t gold containing 584,400 oz and 12.2 Mt inferred @ 1.65 g/t gold containing 651,300 oz for a total of 22.7 Mt @ 1.69 g/t gold, containing 1.24 Moz at 0.5g/t cutoff. The depth of drilling averages only 79 metres on all projects. Note that these estimates include the Homeward Bound South project as well. The discovery cost for all these resources is very low at $24/ounce.. Early work programs have begun at these deposits and all approvals are expected by December 2023. MAU aims to submit a mining proposal to DMIRS in late January 2024. Blue Cap Mining is helping with all key approvals and assessing the economics of the Laverton Project.. Hawks Nest 9: The HN9 (indicated and inferred) resource is estimated at 3.2 Mt at 1.22 g/t gold for 123,000 oz contained within three main zones within a 2-kilometre by 200-metre-wide area and is largely within the indicated category (63 percent). Widespread surface and shallow east-dipping lodes are present in the project area.. Lady Julie Central: The Lady Julie Central (indicated and inferred) resource is estimated at 1.33 Mt at 1.68 g/t gold for 72,200 oz, covering a 350-metre by 200-metre area. Nearly 59 percent of the resource falls in the indicated category.. Lady Julie North 4: LJN4 is by far the largest resource in the project area. The resource (indicated and inferred) is estimated at 13.1 Mt at 2.20 g/t gold for 852,000 oz, covering an 800-metre by 200-metre area, and is open down dip and to the east, which augers well for the potential size. This resource is partly in the indicated category (52 percent). Thick breccia silica pyrite intersections have now been outlined over a 250-metre length in the central and southern part of LJN4, which are very similar to that found in the world-class Sunrise Dam deposit. These zones containing drilling holes (MLJRC789, MLJRC779 and MLJRC679) are now being extended by new drilling at depth and further to the east and northeast. This provides strong potential to grow the LJN4 resource. A 1,390-metre diamond and a 2,555-metre RC program have started and will be scoping out extensions both to the east and northeast with holes planned between 400-metre to 550-metre depth ",0

TGT. FFOXF. SODANKYLÄ, FINLAND / ACCESSWIRE / February 28, 2024 / FireFox Gold Corp. (TSXV:FFOX)(OTCQB:FFOXF)(""FireFox"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report results from an additional six holes totalling 1,617.5 metres of drilling at the Company's 100%-held Mustajärvi Gold Project in Lapland, Finland (Figure 1). The primary focus of the program was four holes (23MJ010-23MJ013) drilled to test for extensions to depth of the near-surface high-grade gold zone at the East Target (Figure 2).. Results confirm that gold mineralization extends deeper to the south, where the system plunges to the southwest and is very likely down dropped by faults south of the surface expression. These holes are the deepest expression of the East Target yet, with strong gold intercepts occurring at more than 250 metres below surface. Even though these holes were significant step outs to the south and southwest, the results demonstrate opportunity for expansion to depth and to the southwest.. Selected Highlights from the latest drilling at the East Target. Drill hole 23MJ013 intercepted:. 13.5m averaging 3.16 g/t Au, from 230.6m depth, including. 1.0m at 18.42 g/t Au; and. 1.0m at 5.31 g/t Au, from 271m depth; and. 6.5m at 1.01 g/t Au, from 281.5m depth.. Drill hole 23MJ011 intercepted:. 3.6m averaging 5.96 g/t Au, from 236.3m depth, including. 0.7m at 21.77 g/t Au; and. 0.8m at 5.93 g/t Au, from 122.85m depth.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. Five of the six drill holes encountered significant gold mineralization, as defined by intercepts above 0.5 g/t Au (see Table 1). The final two holes of the program (23MJ014 and 23MJ015) were collared in, or near, the Central Zone to test a new drilling orientation and a geophysical anomaly.. Carl Lofberg, FireFox's CEO, commented about the new results, ""Our newest drilling has extended the East Target mineralization 100 metres to the southwest and to more than 250 metres vertical depth. In doing so, we have confirmed a southwesterly plunge to the gold zone and picked up deeper gold intercepts across a major fault. These holes have defined a southern band of gold mineralization that needs much more drilling. Our latest results confirm that the gold remains open to southwest and downdip. Our next round of drill targets is already emerging from these new data. We look forward to having the drill back on site in the spring."". Mustajärvi Project and Drill Program Summary. The Mustajärvi Project lies along the highway between the cities of Kittilä and Sodankylä, approximately 17 kilometres east of Kittilä. The project remains at an early stage as FireFox and predecessor companies have drilled approximately 15,752 metres to date, and drilling has delineated three different lodes of gold mineralization along more than 1.5 kilometres of strike so far. Due to its near-surface high-grade nature, the Company has been focusing most recently on the East Target. In addition to testing for extensions at depth, the most recent holes in the East Target attempted to intersect the modelled contact between the Savukoski Group ultramafic volcanic rocks and Sodankylä Group metasediments. As shown in cross section below (Figure 3), FireFox's understanding of this important contact and nearby structures has improved considerably.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. To date, most of the mineralization identified at Mustajärvi is hosted in metasedimentary rocks that have been intensely altered with albite, sericite, local silicification, sulfidation, iron carbonates, and/or cut by quartz-carbonate veining. High grades of gold are associated with quartz-carbonate-tourmaline-pyrite (QCTP) veins, hydrothermal breccias, or semi-massive to massive pyrite controlled by foliations. Gold is often enriched at or near the contact with mafic or ultramafic rocks. Until now, mafic rocks, either representing intrusive dikes and sills or thin layers within the Savukoski volcanics, have not typically been recognized as hosting significant gold grades. These new holes have encountered significant mineralization in numerous places within the mafic rocks, albeit so far at relatively low grades, such as 6.5m at 1.01 g/t Au in drill hole 23MJ013. The mineralized mafic rocks are usually intensely albitized with disseminated pyrite and cut by quartz-carbonate or QCTP veins.. Story continues. Table 1.

The detailed drill pattern along with newly modeled gold shapes at the East Target are shown in Figure 2. Drill hole 23MJ010 was another step out hole southwest from the main high-grade zone, collared between the previously drilled westernmost holes (23MJ005 and 23MJ008). Drill holes 23MJ011 and 23MJ012 were drilled 100 metres east from the same collar in a fan configuration, where both holes plunge to the northwest but at angles of 50° and 70° degrees, respectively. The fourth drill hole, 23MJ013, was collared approximately. Figure 1. Mustajärvi Project showing drilling over ground magnetics and most recent holes labeled.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. 75 metres southeast of 23MJ011 and 23MJ012, making it the southernmost drill hole so far drilled in the East Target (approximately 100 metres farther southwest from previous drilling). FireFox geologists designed these holes to test the southwest and downdip continuation of the near-surface high-grade mineralization and to determine whether the interpreted sub-vertical faults on the south side of the zone are offsetting mineralization.. Detailed Description of Drill Holes. Hole 23MJ010 passed through variably altered (albite, quartz, and sericite) metasediments cut by repeating and alternating mafic dykes or sills, with several intervals of weak and moderate disseminated pyrite. These pyrite mineralized intervals were usually associated with strong sericitization and QCTP or quartz-pyrite veins, but also with fault breccia zones and metasediment-mafic sill contacts. The hole returned two gold mineralized samples above the cutoff grade of 0.5 g/t Au, 0.85m at 2.46 g/t from 128.0m downhole and 0.9m at 2.29 g/t from 198.5m downhole. These zones were associated with mineralized contacts or veining.. Hole 23MJ011 was designed to undercut and confirm the mineralization recorded in hole 23MJ004, as well as to test for further extensions of mineralization to depth. The hole also tested magnetic anomalies near the interpreted contact between the Savukoski Group ultramafic volcanic rocks and the Sodankylä Group metasedimentary rocks. The important contact was confirmed at 94.8m with traces of disseminated pyrite. Figure 2. Plan view of Mustajärvi East drilling with modeled gold shapes projected to surface.. ADVERTISEMENT.

The intercepted contact supports the previously interpreted and modeled Savukoski Group-Sodankylä Group contact as dipping steeply to the southeast..

FireFox Gold Corp. reports positive drilling results from Mustajärvi Gold Project in Lapland, Finland. The program focused on extending the high-grade gold zone at the East Target, with significant gold intercepts found at depths exceeding 250 meters. Five out of six drill holes encountered substantial gold mineralization, showcasing expansion opportunities. CEO Carl Lofberg expressed optimism about the results.. Positive. None.. 02/28/2024 - 06:00 AM. SODANKYLÄ, FINLAND / ACCESSWIRE / February 28, 2024 / FireFox Gold Corp. (TSXV:FFOX)(OTCQB:FFOXF)(""FireFox"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report results from an additional six holes totalling 1,617.5 metres of drilling at the Company's 100%-held Mustajärvi Gold Project in Lapland, Finland (Figure 1). The primary focus of the program was four holes (23MJ010-23MJ013) drilled to test for extensions to depth of the near-surface high-grade gold zone at the East Target (Figure 2).. Results confirm that gold mineralization extends deeper to the south, where the system plunges to the southwest and is very likely down dropped by faults south of the surface expression. These holes are the deepest expression of the East Target yet, with strong gold intercepts occurring at more than 250 metres below surface. Even though these holes were significant step outs to the south and southwest, the results demonstrate opportunity for expansion to depth and to the southwest.. Selected Highlights from the latest drilling at the East Target. Drill hole 23MJ013 intercepted:. 13.5m averaging 3.16 g/t Au, from 230.6m depth, including. 1.0m at 18.42 g/t Au; and. 1.0m at 5.31 g/t Au, from 271m depth; and. 6.5m at 1.01 g/t Au, from 281.5m depth.. Drill hole 23MJ011 intercepted:. 3.6m averaging 5.96 g/t Au, from 236.3m depth, including. 0.7m at 21.77 g/t Au; and. 0.8m at 5.93 g/t Au, from 122.85m depth.. Five of the six drill holes encountered significant gold mineralization, as defined by intercepts above 0.5 g/t Au (see Table 1). The final two holes of the program (23MJ014 and 23MJ015) were collared in, or near, the Central Zone to test a new drilling orientation and a geophysical anomaly.. Carl Lofberg, FireFox's CEO, commented about the new results, ""Our newest drilling has extended the East Target mineralization 100 metres to the southwest and to more than 250 metres vertical depth. In doing so, we have confirmed a southwesterly plunge to the gold zone and picked up deeper gold intercepts across a major fault. These holes have defined a southern band of gold mineralization that needs much more drilling. Our latest results confirm that the gold remains open to southwest and downdip. Our next round of drill targets is already emerging from these new data. We look forward to having the drill back on site in the spring."". Mustajärvi Project and Drill Program Summary. The Mustajärvi Project lies along the highway between the cities of Kittilä and Sodankylä, approximately 17 kilometres east of Kittilä. The project remains at an early stage as FireFox and predecessor companies have drilled approximately 15,752 metres to date, and drilling has delineated three different lodes of gold mineralization along more than 1.5 kilometres of strike so far. Due to its near-surface high-grade nature, the Company has been focusing most recently on the East Target. In addition to testing for extensions at depth, the most recent holes in the East Target attempted to intersect the modelled contact between the Savukoski Group ultramafic volcanic rocks and Sodankylä Group metasediments. As shown in cross section below (Figure 3), FireFox's understanding of this important contact and nearby structures has improved considerably.. To date, most of the mineralization identified at Mustajärvi is hosted in metasedimentary rocks that have been intensely altered with albite, sericite, local silicification, sulfidation, iron carbonates, and/or cut by quartz-carbonate veining. High grades of gold are associated with quartz-carbonate-tourmaline-pyrite (QCTP) veins, hydrothermal breccias, or semi-massive to massive pyrite controlled by foliations. Gold is often enriched at or near the contact with mafic or ultramafic rocks. Until now, mafic rocks, either representing intrusive dikes and sills or thin layers within the Savukoski volcanics, have not typically been recognized as hosting significant gold grades. These new holes have encountered significant mineralization in numerous places within the mafic rocks, albeit so far at relatively low grades, such as 6.5m at 1.01 g/t Au in drill hole 23MJ013. The mineralized mafic rocks are usually intensely albitized with disseminated pyrite and cut by quartz-carbonate or QCTP veins.. Table 1. Significant Drill Intercepts in Drillholes 23MJ010 - 23MJ014. (Cut-off Grade 0.5 g/t Au). Drill Hole. 1.00. 1.56. The detailed drill pattern along with newly modeled gold shapes at the East Target are shown in Figure 2. Drill hole 23MJ010 was another step out hole southwest from the main high-grade zone, collared between the previously drilled westernmost holes (23MJ005 and 23MJ008). Drill holes 23MJ011 and 23MJ012 were drilled 100 metres east from the same collar in a fan configuration, where both holes plunge to the northwest but at angles of 50° and 70° degrees, respectively. The fourth drill hole, 23MJ013, was collared approximately. Figure 1. Mustajärvi Project showing drilling over ground magnetics and most recent holes labeled.. 75 metres southeast of 23MJ011 and 23MJ012, making it the southernmost drill hole so far drilled in the East Target (approximately 100 metres farther southwest from previous drilling). FireFox geologists designed these holes to test the southwest and downdip continuation of the near-surface high-grade mineralization and to determine whether the interpreted sub-vertical faults on the south side of the zone are offsetting mineralization.. Detailed Description of Drill Holes. Hole 23MJ010 passed through variably altered (albite, quartz, and sericite) metasediments cut by repeating and alternating mafic dykes or sills, with several intervals of weak and moderate disseminated pyri",0

View Ora Banda Mining Ltd. ASX:OBM. Ora Banda Mining Ltd (ASX:OBM) has discovered a high-grade gold lode at the Sand King underground prospect of the Davyhurst Gold Project in Western Australia, adding to the prospectivity of the Siberian Gold Complex trend that strikes across the Sand King area.. The company drilled a hole to test for high-grade tension vein (090°) structures in the northern Sand King area, along strike from the main Sand King lode (090°) in a previously unexplored area.. This struck gold, producing intervals of 16 metres at 5.6 g/t gold (090° vein), including 14 metres at 6.2 g/t and 2.8 metres at 11.1 g/t; 3 metres at 14.4 g/t (090° vein), including 2.5 metres at 17 g/t; and 1.4 metres at 10.2 g/t (090° vein).. The new gold hits extend mineralisation a further 100 metres to the north and open a notable exploration window, both further to the north of known mineralisation and at depth, as the ultramafic unit the mineralisation sits beneath dips away to the southeast.. ""Game-changing"" discovery. ""Discovering this high-grade lode system under the ultramafic unit is game-changing for the prospects of a potential underground mine at Sand King,"" Ora Banda Mining managing director Luke Creagh said.. ""Our confidence is growing daily, and it is becoming more apparent that we are only scratching the surface of the Siberia Gold Complex.. ""The Sand King Underground drill out is tracking well and we are excited by the potential to deliver a second underground mine to support our Riverina Underground operations.. ""If achieved, the business will be in a step change position whereby the 1.2-million-tonnes-per-annum Davyhurst process plant will be full of high-grade ore and our production rate will increase substantially."". Sand King Underground. Ora Banda also generated promising results from phase 1 drilling at Sand King, which showed width and grades of sufficiently high quality to be suitable for underground mining.. The results included 7.1 metres at 3.5 g/t gold and 3.3 metres at 5.8 g/t, both from a 060° lode.. Ora Banda says the central Sand King area is presenting as a large mineralised system with the main 060° structure continuing for more than 500 metres of strike, boasting widths from 4 metres to more than 8 metres wide, and grades from 2 g/t to more than 10 g/t.. All in all, the company believes this lode presents excellent potential for bulk tonnes at a moderate grade from underground mining.. To add to this, the newly discovered high-grade lode system in the northern area of Sand King combines well with other discrete high-grade lodes previously identified to the south of the prospect, which OBM believes will complement the bulk mining opportunity in the central system.. Phase 2 drilling at the project is ongoing, with nine of 16 holes completed so far, and additional holes already being planned to follow up the northern lode discovery.. View Price & Profile.

[1] Prior to 9 BBY , [2] the mineral became the target of a community of prospectors and a currency accepted by Doma Dendra at her shop in the Rambler's Reach Outpost . Some priorite shards could also be found on the planet Coruscant . Indeed, the search for priorite was a driving force for the Koboh economy, drawing in many hopeful prospectors to mine the planet for it. Some groups employed mining droids to search for priorite. Others modified the natural landscape to find more lodes of the mineral, including the establishments of several dams in Dredger Gorge , directing the flow of tar away. Many prospectors lost their lives in the pursuit of priorite, killed by either the dangerous fauna of Koboh lurking in the cave systems, cave-ins, or by the Bedlam Raiders , who laid claim to much of the territory near Rambler's Reach Outpost.

La Design Week conferma il ruolo di Brera Design District, che estende il suo ambito d'azione anche al resto dell'anno, promuovendo nuove forme della cultura del progetto con particolare attenzione al lifestyle e al mondo dell'arte e della moda.. In occasione del Fuorisalone 2024, in scena a Milano dal 15 al 21 aprile, Brera Design District presenta la quindicesima edizione della sua Design Week sostenendo il tema ""Materia Natura"" proposto da Fuorisalone, e si impegna a promuovere una riflessione sulle sfide del contemporaneo, incoraggiando una cultura del progetto consapevole dando spazio a pratiche capaci di generare azioni di cambiamento.. L'uomo rappresenta il punto di contatto tra la materia e la natura: oggi, solo attraverso la sua abilità di trasformare le risorse seguendo i principi dell'economia circolare e creando nuovi cicli di vita per la materia mediante lo studio dei comportamenti virtuosi della natura, possiamo immaginare di costruire un futuro sostenibile.. Brera Design Week 2024 coinvolgerà ampiamente la design industry proponendo soluzioni che vanno dall'innovazione dei materiali al design dei servizi, dall'arte al paesaggio domestico e alla tecnologia all'abitare. Da parte degli espositori particolare attenzione sarà rivolta al mercato in costante evoluzione, considerando i consumi e lo stile di vita, nonché le modalità di relazione tra persone, luoghi e oggetti in una cultura sempre più orientata all'immateriale.. Forte dei risultati ottenuti nell'ultima edizione, Brera Design Week conta di superare la quota di 210 eventi anche nel 2024, con una previsione totale di oltre 260 eventi presenti nel distretto, considerati anche i 196 showroom permanenti, che comprendono le 15 nuove aperture da maggio 2023. Questi dati confermano la posizione di Brera in qualità di distretto più rilevante e importante a livello internazionale per il mondo del design, non solo in occasione della sua Design Week.. Un territorio che diventa brand unico nel suo genere, con una densità e una qualità che lo pone come punto di riferimento grazie alla sua offerta commerciale e alla sua identità, in un mix di tradizione, lifestyle, cultura, arte, enogastronomia e hotellerie, in dialogo con professionisti e aziende presenti sul territorio, ma anche con investitori, sponsor ed espositori temporanei.. ""Brera Design District si inserisce nel più ampio disegno dell'Amministrazione di portare la vivacità e la creatività della Design Week nelle vie e nei quartieri di Milano. Quella del design è una settimana di esposizione e incontro per operatori e addetti ai lavori, ma anche un'occasione per offrire alla città, agli abitanti e ai turisti la possibilità di scoprire l'arte del design in tutte le sue forme. E questo è ciò che da anni fa il distretto di Brera offrendo una ricca varietà di appuntamenti, installazioni e workshop che rispecchiano l'anima di un quartiere dal fascino unico e contribuiscono a confermare Milano come capitale mondiale del design"", dichiara Alessia Cappello, Assessora al Lavoro e Sviluppo Economico con deleghe a Moda e Design del Comune di Milano..

Brera Design District © 2024 Illustrazione di Studio Ianus. Un'arrampicata vertiginosa in un'architettura del Seicento o una sessione di forest bathing in una casa del centro città? Tra le vie di Brera, la Milano Design Week si fa sempre più avvincente. Se nelle stanze di Palazzo Clerici, infatti, Lines of Flight intreccia e ingarbuglia una grande rete sospesa, pensata dal collettivo di design Numen/For Use per Porsche, invitando il pubblico a esplorare questa scultura come ""un'amaca sociale"" e un luogo di fuga, al numero 10 di via Formentini, Grand Seiko presenta Materia in Movimento, un bosco urbano di betulle dove (ri)trovare il respiro.. Programma di Brera Design District alla mano, del resto, di pause e momenti di sosta, durante i giorni di Fuorisalone 2024, ne avremo davvero bisogno. Perché la 15esima edizione della rassegna diffusa nel quartiere della Pinacoteca, curata da. Studiolabo ,  si fa sempre più ricca: con l'obiettivo di superare i 200 eventi in calendario, quest'anno il circuito si corre solo partendo in quinta. Dal 15 al 21 aprile, Brera Design Week sostiene il tema ""Materia Natura"", proposto da Fuorisalone, disegnando un tragitto che taglia e cuce lo spazio del centro storico meneghino per raccontare, su tutto, il legame intrinseco e manifesto fra habitat e progettazione. Modalità 2x.. Courtesy photo. Brera Design District: Porsche con ""The Art of Dreams"" presenta ""The Pattern of Dreams"". Brera Fuorisalone 2024: cosa vedere. Il palinsesto della Milano Design Week in Brera apre di nuovo alla città vetrine inedite e luoghi altrimenti inesplorabili, con l'intento di restituire dell'industria creativa il lato più narrativo e, ovviamente, pop(olare). La settimana che all'ombra del Duomo tiene il ritmo del Salone del Mobile.Milano è, di fatto, un Tempo per tutti: addetti ai lavori, appassionati e sì, anche semplici curiosi.. Courtesy photo. Casa Mutina presenta ""Ronan Bouroullec solo show"". Agli allestimenti, quindi, l'onere e l'onore di palesare in modo diretto l'expertise e il valore delle aziende protagoniste; alle firme del design italiano e internazionale, poi, il compito di rendere leggibile e chiaro anche il lato più effimero dell'abitare. In campo vedremo, tra gli altri, il duo Studioboom dare ordine agli oggetti di Fenix, disegnati intorno al concetto del doppio da CARA \ DAVIDE, DWA Design Studio, Martinelli Venezia,Næssi Studio, mist-o e Zanellato/Bortotto, con la curatela di Federica Sala. È una monografica, invece, quella dedicata da Mutina all'opera di Ronan Bouroullec : in scena negli spazi di Casa Mutina Milano, in via Cernaia 1A, e nell'adiacente Spazio Cernaia, vengono presentate due nuove collezioni di rivestimenti, una da interno e una da esterno, insieme a nuovi oggetti in ceramica realizzati in edizione limitata. Matteo Nunziati arruolato da Florim, fra gli altri, fa eco ad ARRCC, i29 e Neri&Hu per Valcucine e, ancora, ad Atelier Biagetti per MCM Wearable Casa.. Fuorisalone Brera 2024: gli showroom in apertura. Al centro della passeggiata che muove il tandem perfetto Fuorisalone Brera sono quindi i negozi e gli headquarter a segnare le prime tappe del viaggio esplorativo: tra le 196 vetrine permanenti, sono ben 15 le nuove aperture da maggio 2023. Se via Fiori Chiari fa doppietta con Schumacher e THG Paris, via Manzoni gioca l'asso pigliatutto con quattro insegne freschissime: Davide Groppi, DePadova, laCividina e Talenti. Nel girotondo di strade chiuso tra le fermate della metropolitana Lanza e Turati, ecco gli showroom di Alice Ceramica, Atelier Tapis Rouge, Calligaris Flagship Store, Delvis Unlimited, Dornbracht, Ceramica Sant'Agostino, Nic, Rossin e Voilàp home..

Visitate le roccaforte dei brand, a rotazione, è tempo per le location più particolari del Fuorisalone 2024: la design week di Milano rappresenta, infatti, l'occasione perfetta per indagare edifici difficilmente resi accessibili o estranei, solitamente, all'esibizione. È il caso del Chiostro della Chiesa di San Marco con dOT & ABLE TO, il Chiostro e la sacrestia monumentale della Chiesa Santa Maria del Carmine allestito da St.Louis e il Chiostro delle Chiese Gemelle occupato da Fim Umbrellas & Coro Italia. Porte aperte anche per le architetture storiche del capoluogo lombardo, tra cui Casa Manzoni, teatro dell'outdoor di MAMAGREEN, Palazzo Cusani con il progetto di Atelier Biagetti e Palazzo Landriani,  sede dell'Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere, che ospita, per l'occasione, la mostra Gravity of Light, incentrata sul tema della cucina, di Poggenpohl..

Punto di arrivo (ma anche di partenza) sono poi gli hub scelti dalle delegazioni straniere come baluardi del proprio saper fare. Brera Design District conferma la vocazione internazionale del suo Dna con due collettive estere: nelle stanze di Casa degli Artisti, la Fondazione svizzera per la cultura Pro Helvetia e Presenza Svizzera puntano i riflettori su un gruppo di talenti che riunisce designer, studi, università, marchi e gallerie dai quattro angoli della Svizzera. ""Alimentati da speranza e ottimismo"", si legge sulla nota stampa, ""attraverso temi come la circolarità, il benessere e il legame con la natura, i progetti offrono un'interpretazione unica della gioia sprigionata dall'ingegno e l'innovazione"". Palazzo Confalonieri – Fondazione Cariplo, invece, è la casa-base della rappresentanza austriaca: Advantage Austria mette in scena una gamma di prodotti dal design innovativo e di alta qualità, attraverso un concept creativo realizzato dai pluripremiati architetti Vasku & Klug.. Escono da ogni logica di confine e appartenenza, in ultimo, le Oasi dell'inclusione di Diwergo: per tutti, senza distinzione, sono 5 le sedute di diversa foggia e natura allestite in Piazza della Chiesa di Santa Maria Incoronata, su Corso Garibaldi, associate a 5 aforismi di Antonio Giuseppe Malafarina.

lodes_0000001313173711,"Nemo's Mayfly Is a Solid, Lightweight 2-Person Backpacking Tent Nemo's Mayfly Is a Solid, Lightweight 2-Person Backpacking Tent Nemo's latest backpacking tent is lightweight, compact, and cleverly designed to maximize living space on the trail.. Nemo's latest backpacking tent is lightweight, compact, and cleverly designed to maximize living space on the trail. Information. WIRED. Semi-freestanding design makes for a roomy but still lightweight shelter. Very simple setup and take-down. Clever pole and fly attachment system makes staking it out quick and easy.. TIRED. Not freestanding. Tight for two people who aren't close.. Nemo Equipment's backpacking gear is not cheap, but it's some of the lightest, best-made, and most well-thought-out gear you'll find on the market. The company's new Mayfly Osmo two-person backpacking tent exemplifies this. The Mayfly Osmo is quick to set up, lightweight, and cleverly designed, and it gave an impression of durability in my five nights of testing.. The Mayfly comes in two- and three-person versions and sits in Nemo's backpacking tent line between the ultralight Dragonfly and Hornet series and the roomier, heavier Dagger series ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ). The Mayfly is a good choice for backpackers looking to pick up a quality Nemo tent that weighs a little more but at $400 costs quite a bit less than the ultralight Hornet.. The Basics. Photograph: Scott Gilbertson. The Mayfly is a three-season backpacking tent with a trail weight of 3 pounds, 8 ounces for the two-person version I tested. Purists might take issue, but to me that puts it firmly in the ultralight tent category. Split between two people, each is carrying under 2 pounds. That's not as light as the Nemo Hornet, which has a trail weight of just 2 pounds, but it's well under our suggestion to keep tent weight under 2.5 pounds per person. The Mayfly is also $250 cheaper than the Hornet, making it easier on the pocketbook.. The Mayfly uses a semi-freestanding design, much like the MSR Freelite we reviewed last year . This design saves on weight since there are fewer poles, but it does mean you have to stake out or otherwise secure the foot-end of the tent. If you're headed somewhere you might camp on hard rock, it's worth adding some extra cord in case you need to get creative.. There are two tent poles, both aluminum. One is a hubbed three-piece pole that forks above the door. The second spreader pole goes across the middle and helps maintain the steep sidewalls that make the Mayfly surprisingly roomy for its dimensions.. The Mayfly offers 27.9 square feet of living space, with two 7-square-foot vestibule areas for gear storage. In practice, this works out to be a livable, though not roomy, tent for two. Since I happened to be testing Nemo's new Tensor Trail sleeping pads as well, I can say that two of those fit side by side, but just barely (see photo). There's a few inches of room down at the feet for gear, but whatever you put down there will be touching the sidewalls, which is often a recipe for wet gear.. Photograph: Scott Gilbertson. Nemo Equipment Mayfly 2-Person Tent. Rating: 8/10. $400 at Nemo. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more . Please also consider subscribing to WIRED. At this weight, the Mayfly's living space is about average. It's nearly identical living space to the Big Agnes Tiger Wall UL 2, and it's a couple square feet smaller than the MSR Freelite. I did not notice the difference much—the Mayfly feels bigger than the Freelite thanks to a wider roof, though it's worth noting the Freelite is almost a pound lighter. The Mayfly is a good size for couples or anyone who doesn't mind being a bit chummy with their partner. It was a perfect fit for me and my 9-year-old son.. Photograph: Scott Gilbertson. Most of the Mayfly is a whitish mesh netting, but the roof is dark mesh to make the view better at night, and stargazing in the Mayfly is quite nice on those nights when you don't need the rainfly. There are two pockets on the ceiling, one above the head which is big enough for a Nalgene water bottle or other smaller items. There's a larger pocket toward the back where you can shove a couple of mid-layers to quickly grab on those chilly mornings. Night light pockets will diffuse your headlamp's LEDs to create a warmer, softer light.. The doors are quite large, and it was easy to get in and out of them, which was my main gripe about the Dagger, which is much harder to access. The floor of the Mayfly is made of 68D ripstop polyester and feels more substantial than others I've used. That said, I always recommend carrying a ground sheet of some kind, whether a piece of Tyvek you cut to shape or the Mayfly footprint Nemo sells for $70 .. Setup and take-down are both super fast and easy. I was able to get the Mayfly up in under three minutes without reading the directions. Adding the fly, staking, and guying it out completely takes a bit longer, but the basic tent is very quick to set up. The poles snap into Nemo's custom Axial corner anchors, and the color-coded webbing makes it simple to figure out which loops go to which pole.. Nemo Equipment Mayfly 2-Person Tent. Rating: 8/10.

View Ora Banda Mining Ltd. ASX:OBM. Ora Banda Mining Ltd (ASX:OBM) has discovered a high-grade gold lode at the Sand King underground prospect of the Davyhurst Gold Project in Western Australia, adding to the prospectivity of the Siberian Gold Complex trend that strikes across the Sand King area.. The company drilled a hole to test for high-grade tension vein (090°) structures in the northern Sand King area, along strike from the main Sand King lode (090°) in a previously unexplored area.. This struck gold, producing intervals of 16 metres at 5.6 g/t gold (090° vein), including 14 metres at 6.2 g/t and 2.8 metres at 11.1 g/t; 3 metres at 14.4 g/t (090° vein), including 2.5 metres at 17 g/t; and 1.4 metres at 10.2 g/t (090° vein).. The new gold hits extend mineralisation a further 100 metres to the north and open a notable exploration window, both further to the north of known mineralisation and at depth, as the ultramafic unit the mineralisation sits beneath dips away to the southeast.. ""Game-changing"" discovery. ""Discovering this high-grade lode system under the ultramafic unit is game-changing for the prospects of a potential underground mine at Sand King,"" Ora Banda Mining managing director Luke Creagh said.. ""Our confidence is growing daily, and it is becoming more apparent that we are only scratching the surface of the Siberia Gold Complex.. ""The Sand King Underground drill out is tracking well and we are excited by the potential to deliver a second underground mine to support our Riverina Underground operations.. ""If achieved, the business will be in a step change position whereby the 1.2-million-tonnes-per-annum Davyhurst process plant will be full of high-grade ore and our production rate will increase substantially."". Sand King Underground. Ora Banda also generated promising results from phase 1 drilling at Sand King, which showed width and grades of sufficiently high quality to be suitable for underground mining.. The results included 7.1 metres at 3.5 g/t gold and 3.3 metres at 5.8 g/t, both from a 060° lode.. Ora Banda says the central Sand King area is presenting as a large mineralised system with the main 060° structure continuing for more than 500 metres of strike, boasting widths from 4 metres to more than 8 metres wide, and grades from 2 g/t to more than 10 g/t.. All in all, the company believes this lode presents excellent potential for bulk tonnes at a moderate grade from underground mining.. To add to this, the newly discovered high-grade lode system in the northern area of Sand King combines well with other discrete high-grade lodes previously identified to the south of the prospect, which OBM believes will complement the bulk mining opportunity in the central system.. Phase 2 drilling at the project is ongoing, with nine of 16 holes completed so far, and additional holes already being planned to follow up the northern lode discovery.. View Price & Profile.

J'avais trouvé un producteur à Saint-Marcet mais ils ne fournissait pas suffisamment. En été, il me faut 400 kg de tomates par semaine"". Chez la petite commerçante au coin de la Halle, trois énormes choux-fleurs trônent sur l'étal à côté de quelques oignons et pommes de terre. ""C'est que du travail, de la nature et du temps, ils ont grossi lentement depuis juillet qu'ils sont en terre"". Un homme demande à se faire partager le chou-fleur, ""je préfère acheter aux gens qui travaillent et qui sont récompensés même si c'est un peu plus cher"". Chez Palmade, ""on achète canards et volailles chez les producteurs du Gers voisin et on prépare magrets, aiguillettes… chez nous à Massabrac"". Une cliente s'exclame : ""Et les produits sont bons, j'y viens régulièrement"". On croise un couple, les paniers bien pleins : ""On se sert surtout chez les producteurs locaux, c'est mieux.

Along with some absolutely stunning vocals by the featured singers throughout, when the full company sang the closing numbers together, it was truly a powerful, audience experience. February 29, 2024 at 3:35 a.m.. | UPDATED:. February 29, 2024 at 3:36 a.m.. Hurray! After having to postpone celebrating its actual 50th anniversary with a musical revue in 2023 (due to COVID-related illnesses affecting members of the cast ensemble during rehearsal), the Humboldt Light Opera Company was finally able to stage two, long-awaited performances this past weekend at the Arkley Center in Eureka. And, all of the talented artists involved made it well worth the wait!. Produced under the watchful eye of the company's intrepid (around 30 years) artistic producing director, Carol McWhorter Ryder, the company lovingly presented a nostalgic, ""February valentine"" to its enthralled audiences. And, the performers not only included veteran locals who had appeared in HLOC productions (that began in 1973), but a number who came back from elsewhere to once again share a stage with them.. (And, a first at the Arkley.). Casey Vaughn and Kara Cress sing ""Wick"" from ""The Secret Garden."" (PC Koczera photo). The artistic format was a smoothly interwoven tapestry of ""fascinating HLOC facts"" delivered by various narrators and musical numbers from a wide and varied selection of productions — both from many years past and current, ranging from classic staples of musical theatre to more edgy, contemporary pieces. (With some ""light opera"" and ""opera"" thrown in as well, and even an audience sing-a-long.). Before the production got under way, there was a big white screen lowered on the stage where photos of people involved with HLOC shows (both onstage and behind the scenes) moved visually through the years. This was also done during intermission and again, most notably, during a touching, poignant ""In Memoriam"" sequence toward the end of the performance honoring those HLOC's ""family"" had lost. This took place with the company coming onstage in the dark, sitting on the floor and holding soft lights while singing a lovely, tribute to them. It was very effective in front of the black background scrim sprinkled with stars that was the only scenic element that stayed in place throughout the show.. Pictured are the ""Pick-a-Little Ladies"" from ""The Music Man as performed by HLOC's The Babes. (PC Koczera photo). Instead of a pit band, the musical scores for each of the specific shows being represented were expertly played by a rotation of three, skilled pianists: Angela Burkhart, Annette Hull and Larry Pitts. When percussion was needed, it was perfectly provided by Mark deLao. And the musical directors for the production were Katri Pitts, Fiona Ryder and Carol Ryder.. Literally ""kicking off things"" to welcome the audience, was the wacky, multi-legged character of Squidward J.Q. Tentacles (Bill Ryder) from. HLOC's most recent hit (in 2023), ""The SpongeBob Musical."" And, he was soon joined by the cast of that marvelous show, singing ""Bikini Bottom Day."". That was followed by Brad Curtis sharing the history of the Humboldt Light Opera Company.. HLOC's Full Company sings ""There is Music in You"" from ""Cinderella."" (PC Koczera photo). There were also informative remarks by other performers scattered between musical numbers, about KidCo; the Classics; Boomer Troupe; Technical Theatre; The Music; Books to Musicals; Adventures with New Musicals; a letter from company co-founder, Phil Kates; Looking to the Future; and Looking to the Past.. I'll now tell you what was performed after the rousing opening number throughout the remainder of this magical musical revue. This will include the shows, when they were staged by HLOC, the songs from those shows, and all of the wonderful singers performing them:. ""Beauty and the Beast"" (2005, 2023 — Junior Company): ""Me,"" Casey Vaughn, Laura Hathaway; ""If I Can't Love Her,"" Keith Richards; ""A Change in Me,"" Laura Hathaway; ""Something There/Beauty and the Beast,"" Laura Hathaway, Carolyn Van Mantgem, Kevin Richards, Taylor Nada, and Cast of ""Beauty and the Beast."".

View Helix Resources Ltd. ASX:HLX. Helix Resources Ltd (ASX:HLX) has pinpointed two new drill targets at its Canbelego Copper Project in central NSW, following a successful trial of the induced polarisation (IP) geophysical survey technique.. Potential for expansion. The IP survey not only confirmed the presence of the known Canbelego Main Lode mineral resource but also highlighted the potential for additional parallel lodes that could significantly expand the size of the copper deposit.. This survey detected three distinct IP chargeability anomalies, suggesting areas rich in sulphide mineralisation to a depth of 400 metres.. Two undrilled anomalies have been identified: one (Central) potentially extends and thickens the Western Lode system, and the other (Western) lies 600 metres west of the Canbelego Main Lode, at a depth of 135 metres.. Helix executive technical director Kylie Prendergast said: ""While it is still early days, the application of IP geophysics is looking like a game-changer for Helix and our exploration of the Rochford Trend.. ""Copper mineralisation occurs as ‘sulphide' minerals in either disseminated, vein stockworks or sometimes massive-sulphide textures. The latter can be conductive and to date, we have relied on measuring that massive, conductive feature utilising electromagnetic or EM survey techniques to identify potential deposits.. Cost-effective, direct detection. ""However, at Bijoux we intersected copper sulphides at grades well above 1% copper but occurring as veins and disseminations and hence unlikely to give an EM response.. ""IP detects sulphide minerals regardless of the textures and we think this technique offers a very cost-effective, direct detection method for finding new copper deposits in the Cobar district.. ""With our multi-disciplinary approach including pathfinder geochemistry, we think IP can identity quite ‘refined' drill targets or eliminate targets, which offers significant savings on drilling expenditure and time.. ""We will now move on to build a fuller picture of the Rochford Trend copper potential by expanding to a wide coverage gradient array IP geophysical survey over known surface copper anomalies and where drill holes have intersected copper sulphide mineralisation, such as the Cabellero and Bijoux prospects.. ""This is an exciting development; fast-tracking Helix on a discovery pathway while saving money and optimising our drill targeting."". What's next?. The company plans to conduct a Gradient Array IP survey across a 9-kilometre section of the Rochford Copper Trend, aiming to optimise and offset some of the planned drilling activities.. This survey is expected to provide a broader understanding of the copper potential within the trend, including the Bijoux copper auger anomaly.. The Canbelego project, a joint venture with Aeris Resources Ltd (ASX:AIS, OTC:ARSRF) , where Helix holds a 70% interest, represents a promising opportunity for the discovery of new copper deposits in the Cobar district.. With the successful application of IP geophysics, Helix Resources is poised to fast-track its exploration efforts, which will lead to significant cost savings and optimised drill targeting..

LinkedIn X (ex-Twitter) WhatsApp Telegram Copier. FireFox Gold Corp.. (TSX.V: FFOX)(OTCQB: FFOXF)('FireFox' or the 'Company') is pleased to report results from an additional six holes totalling 1,617.5 metres of drilling at the Company's 100%-held. Mustajarvi Gold Project. Finland. .. The primary focus of the program was four holes (23MJ010-23MJ013) drilled to test for extensions to depth of the near-surface high-grade gold zone at the East Target.. Results confirm that gold mineralization extends deeper to the south, where the system plunges to the southwest and is very likely down dropped by faults south of the surface expression. These holes are the deepest expression of the East Target yet, with strong gold intercepts occurring at more than 250 metres below surface. Even though these holes were significant step outs to the south and southwest, the results demonstrate opportunity for expansion to depth and to the southwest.. Selected Highlights from the latest drilling at the East Target. Drill hole 23MJ013 intercepted: o 13.5m averaging 3.16 g/t Au, from 230.6m depth, including 1.0m at 18.42 g/t Au and o 1.0m at 5.31 g/t Au, from 271m depth and o 6.5m at 1.01 g/t Au, from 281.5m depth.. Drill hole 23MJ011 intercepted: o 3.6m averaging 5.96 g/t Au, from 236.3m depth, including 0.7m at 21.77 g/t Au and o 0.8m at 5.93 g/t Au, from 122.85m depth.. Five of the six drill holes encountered significant gold mineralization, as defined by intercepts above 0.5 g/t Au. The final two holes of the program (23MJ014 and 23MJ015) were collared in, or near, the. Central Zone. to test a new drilling orientation and a geophysical anomaly.. Carl Lofberg. , FireFox's CEO, commented about the new results, 'Our newest drilling has extended the East Target mineralization 100 metres to the southwest and to more than 250 metres vertical depth. In doing so, we have confirmed a southwesterly plunge to the gold zone and picked up deeper gold intercepts across a major fault. These holes have defined a southern band of gold mineralization that needs much more drilling. Our latest results confirm that the gold remains open to southwest and downdip. Our next round of drill targets is already emerging from these new data. We look forward to having the drill back on site in the spring.'. Mustajarvi Project. and Drill Program Summary. The Mustajarvi Project. lies along the highway between the cities of Kittila and Sodankyla, approximately 17 kilometres east of Kittila. The project remains at an early stage as FireFox and predecessor companies have drilled approximately 15,752 metres to date, and drilling has delineated three different lodes of gold mineralization along more than 1.5 kilometres of strike so far. Due to its near-surface high-grade nature, the Company has been focusing most recently on the East Target. In addition to testing for extensions at depth, the most recent holes in the East Target attempted to intersect the modelled contact between the. Savukoski Group. ultramafic volcanic rocks and. Sodankyla Group. metasediments. As shown in cross section below , FireFox's understanding of this important contact and nearby structures has improved considerably.. To date, most of the mineralization identified at Mustajarvi is hosted in metasedimentary rocks that have been intensely altered with albite, sericite, local silicification, sulfidation, iron carbonates, and/or cut by quartz-carbonate veining. High grades of gold are associated with quartz-carbonate-tourmaline-pyrite (QCTP) veins, hydrothermal breccias, or semi-massive to massive pyrite controlled by foliations. Gold is often enriched at or near the contact with mafic or ultramafic rocks. Until now, mafic rocks, either representing intrusive dikes and sills or thin layers within the Savukoski volcanics, have not typically been recognized as hosting significant gold grades. These new holes have encountered significant mineralization in numerous places within the mafic rocks, albeit so far at relatively low grades, such as 6.5m at 1.01 g/t Au in drill hole 23MJ013. The mineralized mafic rocks are usually intensely albitized with disseminated pyrite and cut by quartz-carbonate or QCTP veins.. Methodology & Quality Assurance. The core was transported from the rig to the Company's core storage facility in Sodankyla, where FireFox's exploration team conducted the geological and geotechnical logging and selected the assay intervals. Assay intervals were generally 1 metre but in some circumstances were modified according to lithological boundaries and other factors. FireFox geologists maintained chain of custody and sampling procedures according to best industry practice and with due attention to quality assurance and quality control, including sampling field duplicates and insertion of certified standard and blank samples.. FireFox team members transported the samples to an ALS sample prep lab in Sodankyla. The samples were sawed then crushed to -2 mm, split and pulverized into 1kg pulps, before being shipped to the ALS facility in. Rosia Montana. ,. Romania. for gold by fire assay of 50 gm aliquots with AAS finish (method Au-AA24). All samples exceeding 10.0 g/t Au were re-assayed in triplicate by fire assay of 50 gm aliquots with a gravimetric finish (method Au-GRA22). Other elements, altogether 48, were measured after four-acid digestion by ICP-AES and ICP-MS (method ME-MS61) at the ALS facility located in. Loughrea, Ireland. .. ALS Laboratories. is a leading international provider of assay and analytical data to the mining industry. All ALS geochemical hub laboratories, including the Irish facility, are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2017 for specific analytical procedures.

Helix Resources Ltd. (ASX:HLX, Helix or the Company) has successfully trialed the use of an Induced Polarisation (IP) geophysical survey technique at the Canbelego Main Lode Mineral Resource.. The results received clearly identify the 'known' Canbelego copper deposit and highlight two new chargeable IP anomalies that have never been drilled. Helix's Executive Technical Director,. Kylie Prendergast. commented: 'While it is still early days, the application of IP geophysics is looking like a game-changer for Helix and our exploration of the Rochford Trend.

This is an exciting development; fast-tracking Helix on a discovery pathway while saving money and optimising our drill targeting. Introduction. The Company has completed an orientation induced polarisation (IP) survey over the Canbelego copper deposit and the Bijoux copper prospect. The aim of the survey was to investigate whether IP could detect known mineralised zones at Canbelego, and whether previously detected electromagnetic (VTEM) anomalies within the regionally significant Rochford Trend have an associated IP response. The Canbelego project area falls with EL6105 a joint venture with. Aeris Resources Ltd. (ASX:AIS); Helix holds 70% and manages the JV, Aeris 30%. The Bijoux prospect, as with the rest of Helix's Cobar regional tenements are 100% held by Helix. At Canbelego the survey consisted of five 1.5km long survey lines over the Main Lode Mineral Resource3 and Western Lodes mineralisation. Four of those lines were parallel across the mineralisation spaced at 200m (170m for the southern line). The fifth line was northeast of the Main Lode across two VTEM anomalies4 . The Bijoux survey consisted of one 1.5km long line across recently discovered significant oxide and copper sulphide mineralisation in RC drillholes5. A pole-dipole (PDIP) array was used for all lines, using 100m receiver dipoles. The PDIP data has been modelled using 2D inversion techniques, and a 3D inversion model for the five Canbelego PDIP lines. The PDIP results confirm that the Main Lode copper mineralisation at Canbelego is detectable by IP and therefore a broader scale gradient array IP (GAIP) survey is being planned for the Canbelego to Bijoux corridor in the Rochford Trend.. Canbelego IP. results The Canbelego PDIP survey generated high-quality and low noise data and has defined three discrete IP chargeability anomalies at a threshold of 30mV/V. The 350m long eastern chargeable anomaly coincides with the known Canbelego Main Lode mineralisation. The top of the chargeable zone is from 125m vertical, deeper than the observed mineralisation which starts near surface. This is partly due to nonchargeable, or poorly chargeable oxide and transition copper mineralisation near surface, and partly due to the 100m dipole size of survey, which was designed to emphasise deeper, rather than shallow, chargeable anomalies. The central chargeable anomaly corresponds to the southern end of the Western Lodes, however the 3D inversion model indicates that the widest part of this anomaly has not been drilled. The western chargeable anomaly is NNW-trending with approximately 300m of strike length. The depth to the top of the chargeable zone is approximately 130m vertical. This anomaly is coincident with a farm track with electric fencing in the south, however interrogation of the data shows no obvious fence effects. Significantly, this anomaly is well outside of the drilled area at Canbelego and represents a new drill target. Similarly, the depth to the top of 30mV/V shell in central and western chargeable anomalies is approximately 140m vertical, and both these anomalies have not been drilled previously. Further refining of these chargeable anomalies will be undertaken after the proposed gradient array IP surveys are completed in the next month. This will include quantifying the impact of the electric fence on the western chargeability anomaly.. Next Steps. Two GAIP surveys are planned; the first covering a 16km2 area from north of Canbelego to south of Caballero, and the second covering a 5km2 area over the Bijoux prospect. A GAIP survey is a cost-effective method surveying large areas to detect chargeability and resistivity anomalies, however GAIP will not provide a depth constraint on any identified anomalies. GAIP anomalies will need to be followed-up with PDIP surveys to accurately define the depth and geometry of the anomalies. Utilisation of GAIP to detect sulphide mineralisation and then PDIP to better define the target ahead of drilling will fast track drill testing and, optimise the drill success rate - saving drill metres and hence expenditure. The GAIP surveys will commence in early. March 2024. , with the surveys expected to be completed in late-March. Follow-up PDIP surveys will be undertaken after that to define drill targets..

Infinity Mining has topped up its total gold resource inventory to 63,000 ounces with the addition of a maiden 2700-ounce gold resource estimate from its Great Northern project in the historic Western Australian Goldfields town of Leonora.. The company has 10 mineral tenements in the Leonora district – comprising seven separate projects – and is developing a portfolio of gold resources throughout the region, with its eye on an initial 500,000-ounce target.. In addition to Great Northern, the company's current inventory comprises more than a million tonnes at a grade of 1.38g/t gold for a total of 48,600 ounces at Craig's Rest, its northernmost project that sits about 60km north of Leonora. It also has its Victor Bore operation, about 10km north of Leonora, which is estimated to have 234,000 tonnes at a grade of 1.56g/t gold for a contained 11,700 ounces.. Infinity's total resource inventory now comprises 1.387 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.41g/t gold for the 63,000 ounces.. TheNightly. Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.. READ NOW. The company's first drilling at Great Northern in 2022 jagged a nice hit in one reverse-circulation (RC) hole, intersecting 4m running 3.68g/t gold from 30m depth including 1m going a useful 10.95g/t gold from 32m.. And in April last year, it revealed that another RC drillhole intersected 3m going 2.9g/t gold from 64m including 1m at 7.49g/t gold from 65m, in addition to further 1m intercepts in two additional holes running at 3.5g/t below 70m.. Management says the current estimates are all in the inferred category, implying that further work will be required to flesh them out to indicated or mining resource categories – as is the way of almost all projects in their infancy. It says its drilling database includes 90 drillholes for all prospects and that while a further 19 rotary air-blast (RAB) holes drilled for a total of 648m are in the database, they were not incorporated into the resource estimates.. Importantly, the company details its methods of intersection selection, stating that its minimum required lode width for inclusion was 2m and lode ends were extended by about 5m, which is a justifiably conservative approach.. Infinity says at Great Northern, its interpretation details two lodes to a maximum of 110m along strike. It also says the south-eastern extremity remains open and that the lode system remains open at depth below current drilling limits.. The company believes its resources have potential as future mining ventures in view of their surface exposure, shallow depth and free-dig potential above the weathering horizon, in addition to the fact that they are confined within an easily open-pittable 100m depth below surface.. Management says it has not yet undertaken any metallurgical studies, believing such work at this early stage to be premature. But it expects ore behaviour to be similar to that at other nearby operations, many of which rely on carbon-in-leach (CIL) technology, implying a non-refractory, low sulphide content.. Infinity has got its foot on good ground in the Central Goldfields – one of the nation's greatest mineralised provinces – with all tenements being within the area of influence of major greenstone belts and their associated major structures that include the Keith-Kilkenny and Perseverance fault systems within the famed Norseman-Wiluna Belt..

Infinity Mining sees ample evidence of historic gold mining at its Great Northern project near Leonora. Credit: File. Infinity Mining has topped up its total gold resource inventory to 63,000 ounces with the addition of a maiden 2700-ounce gold resource estimate from its Great Northern project in the historic Western Australian Goldfields town of Leonora.. The company has 10 mineral tenements in the Leonora district – comprising seven separate projects – and is developing a portfolio of gold resources throughout the region, with its eye on an initial 500,000-ounce target.. In addition to Great Northern, the company's current inventory comprises more than a million tonnes at a grade of 1.38g/t gold for a total of 48,600 ounces at Craig's Rest, its northernmost project that sits about 60km north of Leonora. It also has its Victor Bore operation, about 10km north of Leonora, which is estimated to have 234,000 tonnes at a grade of 1.56g/t gold for a contained 11,700 ounces.. Infinity's total resource inventory now comprises 1.387 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.41g/t gold for the 63,000 ounces.. The company's first drilling at Great Northern in 2022 jagged a nice hit in one reverse-circulation (RC) hole, intersecting 4m running 3.68g/t gold from 30m depth including 1m going a useful 10.95g/t gold from 32m.. And in April last year, it revealed that another RC drillhole intersected 3m going 2.9g/t gold from 64m including 1m at 7.49g/t gold from 65m, in addition to further 1m intercepts in two additional holes running at 3.5g/t below 70m.. Management says the current estimates are all in the inferred category, implying that further work will be required to flesh them out to indicated or mining resource categories – as is the way of almost all projects in their infancy. It says its drilling database includes 90 drillholes for all prospects and that while a further 19 rotary air-blast (RAB) holes drilled for a total of 648m are in the database, they were not incorporated into the resource estimates.. Importantly, the company details its methods of intersection selection, stating that its minimum required lode width for inclusion was 2m and lode ends were extended by about 5m, which is a justifiably conservative approach.. Infinity says at Great Northern, its interpretation details two lodes to a maximum of 110m along strike. It also says the south-eastern extremity remains open and that the lode system remains open at depth below current drilling limits.. The company believes its resources have potential as future mining ventures in view of their surface exposure, shallow depth and free-dig potential above the weathering horizon, in addition to the fact that they are confined within an easily open-pittable 100m depth below surface.. Management says it has not yet undertaken any metallurgical studies, believing such work at this early stage to be premature. But it expects ore behaviour to be similar to that at other nearby operations, many of which rely on carbon-in-leach (CIL) technology, implying a non-refractory, low sulphide content.. Infinity has got its foot on good ground in the Central Goldfields – one of the nation's greatest mineralised provinces – with all tenements being within the area of influence of major greenstone belts and their associated major structures that include the Keith-Kilkenny and Perseverance fault systems within the famed Norseman-Wiluna Belt.. .

Unlocking Business Success: The Vital Importance of Social Media Strategies. Posted by Harvey1234 on February 28th, 2024. In the unique scene of current business, where rivalry is wild and capacities to focus are momentary, laying out a vigorous presence via social media has become favorable, yet basic. Social media stages have advanced from simple specialized devices to crucial centers for showcasing, client commitment, and brand building. We go over the reasons why social media strategies are so important to businesses looking for long-term growth and success.. . 1. Intensifying Brand Awareness. .

Also, social media promoting considers exact focusing on, empowering organizations to arrive at clients probably going to change over.. . 4. Upgrading Client Insights. . Virtual entertainment stages are mother lodes of information, offering important experiences into client conduct, inclinations, and feelings. By breaking down commitment measurements, observing discussions, and gathering information, organizations can acquire a more profound comprehension of their crowd's necessities and inclinations. This data can impact marketing tactics, development of goods, and general company decisions.. 5.Social media is essential for promoting awareness and loyalty to a brand.. Building a faithful consumer base is crucial for long-term success.. By reliably conveying esteem, giving extraordinary client care, and developing a positive brand picture, organizations can transform fulfilled clients into energetic backers who champion their image to companions, family, and devotees.. . 6. Staying up with Competitors. In the present hypercompetitive business scene, remaining on the ball is fundamental for endurance. Organizations that disregard to embrace social media risk falling behind contenders who influence these stages for their potential benefit. By remaining informed about industry patterns, observing contender movement, and improving their social media techniques, organizations can keep an upper hand and position themselves for progress.. . 7. Developing Idea Leadership. Social media gives a stage to organizations to feature their mastery, lay down a good foundation for themselves as industry pioneers, and fabricate validity inside their particular fields.

Adjusting to Developing Shopper Behavior. . Buyer conduct is continually developing, driven by innovative headways, social moves, and evolving inclinations. Organizations that neglect to adjust to these progressions risk becoming outdated. Virtual entertainment procedures permit organizations to remain lithe and responsive, adjusting their informing, content, and contributions to line up with advancing buyer patterns and inclinations.. . 9. Utilizing User-Generated Content. User-generated content (UGC) has emerged as an effective strategy for organisations seeking to boost social media engagement, trustworthiness, and originality. Businesses can use recommendations from peers and social evidence to acquire new consumers and increase brand loyalty by allowing consumers to communicate their experiences, opinions, and images.. 10. Estimating and Enhancing Performance. One of the best benefits of social media showcasing is its quantifiability. Through extensive examination devices given by social media stages, organizations can follow key execution measurements, like commitment, reach, and changes, continuously. This information permits organizations to distinguish what's working, what's not, and make informed changes in accordance with their systems for ideal outcomes.. . 11.

By supporting continuous communications, offering some benefit added content, and encouraging authentic associations, organizations can develop faithful clients who return over and over. Repeat business, positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and sustainable growth are all outcomes of long-term relationships.. . 15. Showing Social Responsibility. In a time where shoppers progressively anticipate that brands should stand firm on friendly and ecological issues, showing social obligation is vital to building trust and steadfastness. Virtual entertainment gives a stage to organizations to grandstand their obligation to corporate social obligation (CSR), supportability, and moral strategic policies. By sharing accounts of effect, supporting causes lined up with their qualities, and participating in reason driven drives, organizations can reverberate with socially-cognizant buyers and separate themselves in the commercial center.. .

The spotlight can be manually rotated up to 360 degrees, allowing for precise light direction, while the visible cable adds an aesthetic detail to the fixture.. With a 32-degree angle of opening and a colour temperature of 2700 K, the Palosanto Spot Wall Light offers versatile lighting options.

Compact, flexible, and durable, it withstands tough climatic conditions and integrates seamlessly into any landscaping project—residential or commercial. Additionally, Palosanto provides a range of filters to further customize the lighting, offering greater control over its ambiance and intensity.

È ancora presto per stilare classifiche, ma possiamo già dire che Emiliano Ponzi è sicuramente tra i protagonisti della Milano Design Week 2024. L'illustratore e artista originario di Reggio Emilia, oggi di stanza a New York, con il suo stile eclettico, poetico e sperimentale, firma per il Salone del Mobile Under the surface, con Design Group Italia e Accurat, un paesaggio sottomarino che ci invita a riflettere sull'impatto delle pratiche quotidiane su una delle risorse più preziose e vitali: l'acqua. Mentre al Brera Design District, Ponzi ci sorprende con una maxi installazione site-specific, un'esplosione di colori che ci avvolge e ci invita a percorrere un tunnel vibrante di forme e cromie, che culmina in una grande opera artistica dal forte impatto visivo. L'installazione fa parte del più ampio progetto artistico itinerante glo for art.. Emiliano Ponzi per glo -  Ph. Piero Gemelli. The pattern of dreams di Porsche. Dove: Palazzo Clerici, via Clerici 5. Un'opera d'arte monumentale e coinvolgente. Una rete sospesa, una maglia di leggere cellule di metallo, come una colonia di ali vibranti, su cui è tesa o dispiegata fluidamente una sorta di ""pelle"" sottoforma di reticolo trasparente. È Lines of flight di Numen/For Use, collettivo guidato da Sven Jonke, Christoph Katzler e Nikola Radeljković, che per l'occasione hanno collaborato con l'architetta e scenografa croata Ivana Jonke.. Il team, coinvolto da Porsche, si è spirato al celebre motivo pepita che riveste gli interni della leggendaria vettura 356C, 911 della casa automobilistica tedesca.. L'installazione invita i visitatori a salirci e a esplorarla come ""un'amaca sociale"" e un luogo di fuga, transizione, fantasia e libertà. Fa parte di The pattern of dreams, il nuovo capitolo incentrato sul tema del pattern, del ritmo e dalla ripetizione, della serie The art of dreams, l'iniziativa, giunta alla quinta edizione, per connettere il largo pubblico con le più feconde comunità creative, attraverso la commissione di artworks ispirati al tema dei sogni..

Un percorso sensoriale e naturale seguito, per contrasto, da una foresta urbana popolata da ledwall verticali. Una riflessione sull'equilibrio, sempre più in bilico, tra uomo e natura.. Nota per gli appassionati di orologi: in mostra ci sarà il Kodo Constant-force Tourbillon della maison.. Credits: Grand Seiko, Kodo Constant Force Tourbillon. Design duo double feature di Fenix.

Dove: Corriere della Sera, Living, Abitare, ingresso da via Solferino 26. ""La città miniera racconta la città come una possibile riserva del futuro"", così Mario Cucinella racconta il suo progetto per Corriere della Sera. ""Secondo questa idea, possiamo immaginare lo spazio urbano come un ecosistema, che decostruendosi si trasforma a partire dalla sua stessa materia come avviene in natura. Un'idea di circolarità declinata all'architettura in cui il processo creativo diventa centrale"".. Una passeggiata all'interno dello storico cortile consentirà di scoprire una ""nuova"" città progettata e costruita con casse della frutta in legno che, dopo aver dato vita a uno spazio urbano inedito, saranno smontate per tornare alla loro funzione originale..

Over 165 events, 15 new openings for a total of 196 showrooms: our selection of exhibitions, installations, maxi site-specific works of art and presentations of new collections that will animate Brera at Design Week 2024. Brera Design District 2024, one of the longest-running districts and with the highest concentration of showrooms of the FuoriSalone in Milan, returns from 15 to 21 April with the Brera Design Week , now in its fifteenth edition.. Starting from the macro theme proposed by the FuoriSalone, that is Matter Nature, Brera Design Week, curated by Studiolabo , promotes and encourages a more conscious design culture, and gives space to actors and practices capable of generating concrete and virtuous actions of change , following the principles of the circular economy.. ""Brera Design District is part of the administration's broader plan to bring the liveliness and creativity of Design Week to the streets and neighborhoods of Milan"", declares Alessia Cappello, councilor for labor and economic development with responsibilities for fashion and design for the Municipality of Milan.. ""The design week is a week of exhibition and meeting for operators and professionals, but also an opportunity to offer the city, its inhabitants and tourists the opportunity to discover the art of design in all its forms. And this is what the Brera district has been doing for years, offering a rich variety of events, installations and workshops that reflect the soul of a neighborhood with a unique charm and contribute to confirming Milan as the world capital of design "".. Brera Design District 2024 -  Credits: Studio Ianus. What to see at the Brera Design District for the FuoriSalone 2024: events not to be missed (list being updated). More than 165 events on the calendar confirmed to date (the district expects to exceed over 260 events), including exhibitions, installations, maxi site-specific works of art and product presentations, in addition to 15 new openings (from May 2023 ) for a total of 196 showrooms. Here are the events not to be missed, with all the useful addresses to mark on the map.. INTERIORS Cross vision - SunRICE - The recipe for happiness. Where: Brera Botanical Garden, via Brera 28 / via Fiori Oscuri 4. The spheres of the universes of food, energy and architecture intersect in the installation (which promises to be spectacular) INTERIORS Cross vision - SunRICE - The recipe for happiness, signed by Carlo Ratti Associati and Italo Rota , part of the rich schedule of our magazine INTERNI on the occasion of the FuoriSalone 2024.. A project on sharing the key themes of health, well-being, skills and training, tradition and innovation, central elements for Eni and for the three-starred chef Niko Romito, who supports the company in the initiative.. INTERNI Cross Vision, SunRICE, La ricetta della Felicità. Emiliano Ponzi's installation for glo for art. Where: Gattinoni Hub, via Statuto 2. It is still early to draw up rankings, but we can already say that Emiliano Ponzi is certainly among the protagonists of Milan Design Week 2024. The illustrator and artist originally from Reggio Emilia, now based in New York, with his eclectic, poetic and experimental style, signature for the Salone del MobileUnder the surface, with Design Group Italia and Accurat, an underwater landscape that invites us to reflect on the impact of daily practices on one of the most precious and vital resources: water. While at the Brera Design District, Ponzi surprises us with a maxi site-specific installation, an explosion of colors that envelops us and invites us to walk through a vibrant tunnel of shapes and colors, which culminates in a great artistic work with a strong visual impact. The installation is part of the larger traveling artistic project glo for art.. Emiliano Ponzi per glo -  Ph. Piero Gemelli. The pattern of dreams by Porsche. Where: Palazzo Clerici, via Clerici 5. A monumental and engaging work of art. A suspended network, a mesh of light metal cells, like a colony of vibrating wings, on which a sort of ""skin"" in the form of a transparent lattice is stretched or fluidly unfolded. It isLines of flight by Numen/For Use, a collective led by Sven Jonke, Christoph Katzler and NikolaRadeljković, who for the occasion collaborated with the Croatian architect and set designer Ivana Jonke.. The team, involved by Porsche, took inspiration from the famous nugget motif that covers the interior of the legendary 356C, 911 car of the German car manufacturer.. The installation invites visitors to climb on it and explore it as ""a social hammock"" and a place of escape, transition, fantasy and freedom. It is part of The pattern of dreams, the new chapter focused on the theme of pattern, rhythm and repetition, of the series The art of dreams, the initiative, now in its fifth edition, to connect the open sea public with the most fruitful creative communities, through the commission of artworks inspired by the theme of dreams.. TAOD, Milan, Numen For Use -  Credits: Porsche. Matter in motion by Grand Seiko. Where: Casa Brera, via Formentini 10. Grand Seiko transforms Casa Brera into a birch forest, where you can experiment and practice forest bathing, that is, a saving and regenerating immersion in nature.. A sensory and natural path followed, by contrast, by an urban forest populated by vertical LED walls. A reflection on the increasingly precarious balance between man and nature.. Note for watch enthusiasts: on display will be the company's Kodo Constant-force Tourbillon.. Credits: Grand Seiko, Kodo Constant Force Tourbillon. Duo double feature design by Fenix. Where: Fenix Scenario, via Quintino Sella 1, corner Foro Buonaparte. The curator is a guarantee: Federica Sala. The protagonists are among the most interesting on the design scene: Cara\Davide, Dwa Design Studio, Martinelli Venezia, Næssi Studio, mist-o and Zanellato/Bortotto.Design duo double featureby Fenix investigates the potential of matter and surfaces starting from the concept of the double, through furnishing elements and multifaceted functions in the setup designed by Studioboom.. Architectural scenarios by Valcucine. Where: Valcucine, Corso Garibaldi 99. In the year of Eurocucina, the biennial Salone del Mobile dedicated to kitchens and furnishing and hi-tech solutions that revolve around the gourmet universe, Valcucine participates in the Brera Design District with Architectural scenarios, a collective exhibition that talks about the versatility and integration with architecture of its kitchen program, and the brand's environmental commitment.

Where: Corriere della Sera, Living, Abitare, entrance from via Solferino 26. ""The mining city describes the city as a possible reserve for the future"", this is how Mario Cucinella explains his project for Corriere della Sera. ""According to this idea, we can imagine urban space as an ecosystem, which by deconstructing transforms itself starting from its own material as happens in nature. An idea of circularity applied to architecture in which the creative process becomes central."".

View Helix Resources Ltd. ASX:HLX. Helix Resources Ltd (ASX:HLX) has pinpointed two new drill targets at its Canbelego Copper Project in central NSW, following a successful trial of the induced polarisation (IP) geophysical survey technique.. Potential for expansion. The IP survey not only confirmed the presence of the known Canbelego Main Lode mineral resource but also highlighted the potential for additional parallel lodes that could significantly expand the size of the copper deposit.. This survey detected three distinct IP chargeability anomalies, suggesting areas rich in sulphide mineralisation to a depth of 400 metres.. Two undrilled anomalies have been identified: one (Central) potentially extends and thickens the Western Lode system, and the other (Western) lies 600 metres west of the Canbelego Main Lode, at a depth of 135 metres.. Helix executive technical director Kylie Prendergast said: ""While it is still early days, the application of IP geophysics is looking like a game-changer for Helix and our exploration of the Rochford Trend.. ""Copper mineralisation occurs as ‘sulphide' minerals in either disseminated, vein stockworks or sometimes massive-sulphide textures. The latter can be conductive and to date, we have relied on measuring that massive, conductive feature utilising electromagnetic or EM survey techniques to identify potential deposits.. Cost-effective, direct detection. ""However, at Bijoux we intersected copper sulphides at grades well above 1% copper but occurring as veins and disseminations and hence unlikely to give an EM response.. ""IP detects sulphide minerals regardless of the textures and we think this technique offers a very cost-effective, direct detection method for finding new copper deposits in the Cobar district.. ""With our multi-disciplinary approach including pathfinder geochemistry, we think IP can identity quite ‘refined' drill targets or eliminate targets, which offers significant savings on drilling expenditure and time.. ""We will now move on to build a fuller picture of the Rochford Trend copper potential by expanding to a wide coverage gradient array IP geophysical survey over known surface copper anomalies and where drill holes have intersected copper sulphide mineralisation, such as the Cabellero and Bijoux prospects.. ""This is an exciting development; fast-tracking Helix on a discovery pathway while saving money and optimising our drill targeting."". What's next?. The company plans to conduct a Gradient Array IP survey across a 9-kilometre section of the Rochford Copper Trend, aiming to optimise and offset some of the planned drilling activities.. This survey is expected to provide a broader understanding of the copper potential within the trend, including the Bijoux copper auger anomaly.. The Canbelego project, a joint venture with Aeris Resources Ltd (ASX:AIS, OTC:ARSRF) , where Helix holds a 70% interest, represents a promising opportunity for the discovery of new copper deposits in the Cobar district.. With the successful application of IP geophysics, Helix Resources is poised to fast-track its exploration efforts, which will lead to significant cost savings and optimised drill targeting..

Were all aglow with earth's transparency. Orisa-nla,Orunmila,Esu,Ifa  were  all  assembled. Wordlessly he rose,sought knowledge in the hills. Ogun the lone one saw it all,the secret. Veins of matter,and the circling lodes. Sango's spent thunderbolt served him a hammer-head. His fingers touched earth-core,and it yielded. To think,a mere plague of finite chaos Stood between the gods and man. He made a mesh of elements,from stone. Of fire in carthfruit,the womb of energics. He made an anvil of the peaks,and kneaded. Red clay for his mould.. In his hand the Weapon Gleamed,born of the primal mechanic. And this pledge he gave the heavens I will clear a path to man. His task was ended,he declined the crown. Of deities,sought retreat in heights.But Ire. Laid skilled siege to divine withdrawal.Alas. For diplomatic arts,the Elders of Ire prevailed; He descended,and they crowned him king. Who speaks to me in chance recesses Who guides the finger's eye. Now he climbs in reparation,who annointed. Godhead in carnage,O let heaven loose the bolts Of last season's dam for him to lave his fingers. Merely,and in the heady line of blood. Vultures   drown.Merely,. And in the lungstreams of depleted pastures Earth is fattened.O the children of Ogun   Reaped red earth that harvest,rain.

Yet had he  fed when his primal task was  done  Fugitive  from  man  and  god,ever  seeking  hills   And  rock  bounds.Idanre's  granite  offered  peace And there he  dwelt until the  emissaries  came  -  Lcad  us  king,and  warlord.. Who speaks to me I cannot tell. Who  guides  the  hammer's  flight. Gods  drowse  in  borcdom,and  their  pity. Is  easy  roused with  lush  obsequious  rites. Because the rodent nibbled somewhat at his yam, The  farmer  hired  a  hunter,filled  him  with  wine  And thrust a firebrand in his hand. We  do  not  burn  the  woods  to  trap.

Jau pirmajā grūdienā nopietnu pieteikumu uz titulu veica 25 gadus vecā vāciete Jemisi Ogunleje, kura sasniedza 20,19 metrus un par 62 centimetriem laboja savu personīgo rekordu (ieskaitot arī sacensības ārā).

Pēdējā piegājienā, jau būdama čempiones godā, kanādiete sasniedza arī 20,22 metrus un vēlreiz laboja Kanādas telpu rekordu. Mitone ir arī Kanādas rekordiste stadionā – 20,33 metri.

Aluminum became a cheap commodity after WWII, encouraging midcentury architects like Albert Frey to experiment with its strength and surface finishes. More…. Why Aluminum Was Used in Midcentury Modern Architecture. Aluminum became a cheap commodity after World War II, encouraging midcentury architects such as Albert Frey to experiment with its strength and surface finishes.. Brise soleil made of aluminum tubing creates a shaded walkway at Palm Springs City Hall.. PHOTO BY FREDRIK BRODÉN. Albert Frey had a simplistic but accurate view of history. ""We had the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age,"" the architect said in 1987. ""I believe we're in the Age of Aluminum."". Frey began using aluminum with the experimental Aluminaire House of 1931. Originally built in New York, the lauded structure was gifted to the Palm Springs Art Museum, where it has been meticulously reconstructed over the last six months. The museum will officially open the three-story structure, now part of its permanent collection, on March 23 with a community celebration .. For his futuristic build, Frey sourced interior support columns and beams — as well as ribbed panels for the outside — from Alcoa Corporation (also known as the Aluminum Company of America). The house looked as peculiar as the Ford Trimotor airplane of the late 1920s. Rather than a fabric-covered fuselage, à la Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, the Trimotor's fuselage wore corrugated aluminum panels, becoming known as the Tin Goose. The Aluminaire provoked less affectionate terms. Aghast about ""the canned house,"" a New York Times reviewer deadpanned, ""If  father wants a new door cut through to his room, he doesn't get a saw. He gets a can opener."". Frey, who partnered with A. Lawrence Kocher on the design, brushed off the yucks at his expense. He was answering reasonable questions posed by an abundance of new materials. Among those new commodities: Thousands of cubic yards of concrete went into grain elevators in the 1890s in Buffalo, New York; plate glass was perfected on an industrial scale in 1918; vinyl — a Frey favorite — rolled onto the market in 1920. Design-minded people were inspired.. Perfected by 1895 in Pittsburgh, the first allotments of mass-produced aluminum served automotive, military, and nautical applications. The America's Cup winner that year was Defender, an all-metal yacht. Aluminum wire worked well in power lines, but breakthroughs in building construction required more time.. The Aluminaire's skeleton, midconstruction in Palm Springs.. PHOTO BY FREDRIK BRODÉN. ""New structural systems use skeleton frames, take advantage of tensile strength in materials, and combine frames with stressed coverings,"" Frey wrote in his 1939 tract, In Search of a Living Architecture. He hoped public tastes would develop favorably with increased exposure to the new material. It didn't widely catch on. Some 58 years later, in conversation with The Desert Sun, Frey lamented, ""People seem kind of lazy-minded."" He was a staunch proponent of cost-effective industrial materials. Even at the end of his life, Frey's gold Plymouth Reliant wore a vanity plate emblazoned with ""ALUMI."". The architect's job was to figure out how to make desert houses — consisting of precise modules and representing ""the static equilibrium between vertical and horizontal masses,"" as Frey wrote — nestle into creosote and boulder fields and look as if  they belonged. The irregular ridges and spiky shapes of nature presented a harmonic challenge, one full of possibilities.. ""The ever-changing natural surroundings become an indispensable element of composition for avoiding monotony,"" Frey wrote.. In 1934, the Kocher-Sampson Building — Frey's first project in the nascent village of Palm Springs — exemplified his thinking at 766 N. Palm Canyon Drive. No villagers had ever seen anything like this live-work building. Its narrow profile and glassy countenance suggested commerce, as did signage above the entrance. Yet the upstairs living quarters, an offset cube with a striking westward view and an exclusive pool terrace, supplied a resort feel. Demonstrating economic principles of construction, the office level bore a corrugated aluminum ceiling, a feature present in many of Frey's structures.. Around this time, aluminum had become known as ""frozen energy."" It is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust and the third most abundant element overall after oxygen and silicon. But there are no great veins of aluminum, no mother lodes, no eureka moments. In fact, aluminum doesn't exist in a metallic state. Instead, it must be refined from chunky bauxite ore into an oxide-rich substance called alumina.. Shown here in New York in the 1930s, the prototype Aluminaire House has been disassembled and reassembled three times prior to relocating to the Coachella Valley. The structure officially opens March 23 at the Palm Springs Art Museum.. PHOTO COURTESY SPECIAL COLLECTIONS, JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER JR. LIBRARY, THE COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG FOUNDATION. Historically, alumina was combined with cryolite crystals, a flux agent, inside a cell or pot. After applying intensive heat and a jolt of  electricity, the translucent cryolite dissolved, carrying away carbon dioxide and fluorocarbons. The result was pure, bluish-white, molten aluminum.. Mass production of aluminum became practical when big hydropower stations opened. The first was at Niagara Falls in 1895, and its debut roughly coincided with the perfection of the Hall-Héroult smelting process. Eventually, such places as the Tennessee River Valley produced hydropower too, and aluminum production spread. With its glacial meltwaters, Iceland has abundant hydropower; it also has three aluminum smelters, which use 80 percent of the country's energy. Upon depletion of the world's only cryolite mine at Ivittutt, Greenland, in the 1980s, the refining process evolved to use caustic soda, a synthetic, in place of  the mineral.. In 1885, aluminum cost $8 per pound — a luxurious indulgence. Henry Clay Frick, chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company, ""papered"" a wall of  his Pittsburgh home with decorative aluminum leaf. The historic site now draws visitors from all over to marvel at the preserved Gilded Age design. By the early 1940s, the price had fallen to 15 cents per pound. Especially because of airplane production, aluminum became a strategic metal during World War II. It could be rolled into a sheet, poured molten into a mold for casting into a solid shape such as a wheel, or extruded into architectural forms like window frames. (Aluminum siding became popular in the midcentury period.) It took a while to develop the technique, but pieces of aluminum could be welded together using advanced, low-temperature equipment. The metal also accepted adhesive bonding. And yet another attribute of aluminum is endless recyclability.. ""It doesn't rust or corrode,"" Frey said. ""It is less expensive, light, and easier to work with than steel."" It fit well with art deco applications and perfectly represented streamlined shapes. Aluminum could accept a coat of paint, but some, including furniture designer Warren McArthur, worked with anodized aluminum, colorized through an electrochemical process. After dipping the metal into a sulfur bath, oxides emerge, and the surface becomes porous. Then a dye bath suffuses the metal with fade-free color.. ""The color tones that resulted, marketed in shades like Golf Green and Alice Blue, were incredibly popular and soon became an icon of 1930s Hollywood,"" writes Quentin R. Skrabec in Aluminum in America: A History. In McArthur's Hollywood debut, he supplied 2,700 seats to the Warner Grand Theatre. Additional product development occurred, and by the late 1950s, colorful anodized drinkware became popular; although, Frey's collection of tumblers (still on d",0

The best boutique hotels in Lisbon. Mary Lussiana. March 1, 2024 at 7:00 PM. 7 min read. Palácio Príncipe Real has charming interior design and a lush garden filled with purple-hued wisteria and jacaranda - Francisco Nogueira/Francisco Nogueira. Lisbon, with its narrow-cobbled streets, bougainvillea-clad squares, sea views and seven steep hills (the signature yellow trams rattling up and down), suits small boutique properties that maintain a sense of character and a feeling of a home not a hotel. Lisbon , unlike so much of the world, has not gone global; it remains resolutely Portuguese , looking out to sea, with its back to the rest of Europe and its identity intact.. Below is the best of the small, stylish and independent hotels tucked into hidden corners of the capital, like Hotel das Amoreiras, set in one of Lisbon's prettiest squares looking onto the capital's 18th-century aqueduct, or Memmo Príncipe Real reached down a tiny alleyway that opens onto a view right across the red roofs to the Tagus River. Or secret oases like Palácio Príncipe Real, where a lush garden transports you to a fragranced, purple-hued world of wisteria and jacaranda. Little gems, all of them, and all of them waiting for visitors. These are the best boutique hotels in Lisbon.. How we review. Every hotel in this curated list has been visited by one of our expert reviewers, who are usually hosted on a complimentary basis. They stay for a minimum of one night, test at least one meal and trial other experiences that the hotel might have to offer.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. This hotel stands on one of Lisbon's prettiest squares, Praça de Camões, with a statue of Luís de Camões, Portugal's greatest poet in its centre. It's in the vibrant quarter of Bairro Alto (long a haunt of artists and writers) and could easily be described as the grande dame of Lisbon's boutique hotel scene. Behind its ochre-coloured façade, it houses 87 rooms, the first outpost of chef Nuno Mendes in his home town, and a much sought-after roof terrace. The overall character is one of a warm and welcoming townhouse with a strong sense of place.. • An insider guide to Lisbon. Designed by architect Samuel Torres de Carvalho, who was also responsible for the previous Memmo hotels, the overall character here is one of contemporary elegance rooted in Portuguese heritage. Drawing on local materials from warm limestone to old hand-painted tiles, modern art by Miguel Branco, Barahona Possollo and Iva Viana and even hand-made hats from an old, established, neighbouring store, Memmo Príncipe Real blends the area's past with a decidedly 21st century form of luxury.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. These two turn-of-the-century mansions have been elegantly converted into a boutique bolthole. A beautiful swimming pool inset on a cobbled terrace offers views right across the capital, whilst restaurant The Black Pavilion delivers seriously good modern Portuguese fare. There are 26 rooms, one apartment and one villa. Décor is a mix of elegantly classic or contemporary, but all rooms come with a cosy vibe: beds are clad in the softest of linens with a warm, Portuguese woven rug underfoot, windows have glossy white shutters, and balconies are covered in local, brightly coloured tiles.. • The best hotels in Lisbon with a pool. This elegant 18th-century palace, painstakingly restored, houses 18 luxurious rooms including two sumptuous suites, lavishly adorned with original stucco work. The hotel's rooftop, swimming pool and Suba Restaurant offer unrivalled 360-degree views of Lisbon's skyline and the River Tagus beyond. Throughout the building there is an emphasis on allowing the characteristic Lisbon light in. Colours mix soft blues, beige and greys, with some rooms clad in silk wallpaper, others in raw linen. Despite the palatial feel to the building its character is warm and inviting.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. While respecting the original heritage of this 18th-century house, which unlike so much of Lisbon survived the earthquake of 1755, the interior of this hilltop hotel pays homage to 21st-century design. The walls may be clad in local limestone but light fixtures comes courtesy of Italian designer Davide Groppi, chairs and tables from Carl Hansen and, in the rooms, beds from B&B Italia. The overall effect lends a serene atmosphere paired with a strong sense of history. An essay in simplicity, the six beautiful suites all look over the roofs of old Lisbon towards the Tagus.. • The  best nightlife in Lisbon. A 19th-century palace in perfect pink, surrounded by leafy gardens of jacaranda and lemon trees and inset with a swimming pool, is set to be the new go-to hotel for Lisbon tourists. It offers 25 bedrooms, many indulgently large with free-standing bath tubs, within beautifully restored interiors. It's a passion project from British owners Miles and Gail Curley, who came to Lisbon and fell in love with the palacio. Some rooms have terraces and some balconies but all have a view over the wonderful gardens. Beds are clad in crisp cottons, bathrooms in local limestone come with heated floors and Byredo amenities.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. In charming Chiado, the authentic Lisbon of yellow trams and purple jacaranda, narrow, cobbled, streets and imposing churches, this luxury opening offers 61 rooms and suites behind its beautifully restored, 18th-century, daffodil-coloured walls. Wine is a central theme throughout, from the Caudalie Vinothérapie Spa to the Portuguese wine tasting experiences held under the ancient vaulted brick ceiling of the bar. Original blue and white tiles can be found throughout the building as can stuccoed and frescoed ceilings, an impressive staircase and a small chapel. Inside the thick stone walls the hotel hangs heavy with history and offers a real sense of place.. •  Where to stay in Lisbon: hotels by area. Set in one of Lisbon's prettiest squares, facing the mulberry tree-filled gardens after which the square is named, these two converted town houses offer an under-the-radar gem, housing 17 bedrooms, two suites, a courtyard and a stylish bar for breakfast and snacks. Step inside to find fresh flowers, polished antique furniture and pictures from owner Pedro Oliveira's private collection. These range from a screen print by Alberto Giacometti to an original James Bond poster above the bar, to a painting of Lisbon by Pedro's father, who gave it to him when he left Lisbon decades ago so he would not forget the city.. ADVERTISEMENT. Advertisement. Buried in the tiny streets of Chiado, this 19th-century haven offers tranquillity from the bustle of the city which its 20 rooms look onto, with views stretching across the red roofs and up to the castle on the skyline. Rooms are furnished with antiques and some have hot tubs on their private terraces (pictured). Nothing is too much trouble for the young, friendly staff and facilities abound to make you feel at home. Outside in the little garden is a small, heated swimming pool which is open throughout the year.. • The  best five-star hotels in Lisbon. This is the Lisbon outpost of the Sublime hotel group, and a worthy follo",1

Poltrona Frau is a furniture-maker founded in 1912 by Sardinian-born Renzo Frau in Turin, Italy, headquartered since the early 1960s in Tolentino, Italy and specializing in leather seating for interior and automotive applications.

Noted for their exhaustive quality standards, the company uses a 21-step leather tanning process (vs. industry standard ranging from 12-15 steps) where the full-grain leather is dyed through, so a surface scratch won ‘t reveal a lining underneath. 95% of the company's products are made by hand! In 2004, Poltrona Frau acquired noted Italian furniture company Cappellini and the Poltrona Frau Group now includes brands Poltrona Frau, Cappellini, Cassina, Alias, Nemo Lighting, Ceramica Flaminia and Fish Design.

This hotel stands on one of Lisbon's prettiest squares, Praça de Camões, with a statue of Luís de Camões, Portugal's greatest poet in its centre. It's in the vibrant quarter of Bairro Alto (long a haunt of artists and writers) and could easily be described as the grande dame of Lisbon's boutique hotel scene. Behind its ochre-coloured façade, it houses 87 rooms, the first outpost of chef Nuno Mendes in his home town, and a much sought-after roof terrace.

At the origin of Flos there is a bright thought: the idea of giving birth to objects suitable to change the way of living, not only of Italians. So at the beginning of the 60s a certain Mr Gavina, with the small producer of Merano Eisenkeil, gets in the lead - after having created many new furniture (with the brothers Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Afra and Tobia Scarpa and other masters of design) - that it is also time to create new lamps. So the Castiglioni and the Scarpa, with the cocoon technique, conceived in the USA and experimented by Eisenkeil, begin to make lamps such as the Taraxacum or the Fantasma. Many other lamps, beautiful and surprising, follow these first ones: so already from its prehistory Flos (Fiore, in Latin, name that Pier Giacomo Castiglioni chooses for her) finds himself reinventing the idea of artificial lighting..

According to JLL data, this includ One new luxury hotel opens in Sydney in Q4. The world's largest W Hotel recently added 586 rooms to the city's stock.. A total of 816 hotel rooms opened in Sydney over the year-to-date December 2023, which represents a 3.7% of total room stock. According to JLL data, this includes the most recent opening of the luxury 586-room W Sydney. This is the world's largest W Hotel, which opened in early October after significant delays and the collapse of multiple builders.. Here's more from JLL:. Five new hotels are currently under construction in Sydney CBD and surrounding fringe suburbs, representing a net increase of 855 rooms or 3.8% on existing stock. It is expected that future development activity will be relatively constrained in Sydney, given the limited availability of sites, elevated construction costs, macroeconomic challenges, and the availability of development finance.. Rebounding corporate demand and events schedule fuels recovery. Sydney's annual events calendar continues to grow and remains crucial in sustaining the city's tourism and hotel sector, with peak room night demand occurring during events such as Vivid Sydney, FIFA Women's World Cup, SXSW and NYE celebrations. While demand has been largely underpinned by domestic leisure, there is now a noticeable rebound in corporate/MICE demand and inbound visitor arrivals.. Market occupancy as of YTD December 2023 improved to 79.1% y-o-y, versus 61.9% for the same period in 2022, which makes it the highest current occupancy level nationally of any key city market. Despite this ongoing recovery, occupancy remains below pre-pandemic levels, illustrated by a pre-COVID-19 occupancy rate of 85.5% for the same period in 2019.. Strong RevPAR recovery driven by an uplift in occupancy. As of YTD December 2023, revenue per available room (RevPAR) increased to sit at AUD 247, which represents a 35% increase from the previous year, and has now recovered to be 14% above pre-pandemic levels (YTD December 2019). This recovery has been driven by strong ADRs and a steady uplift in market occupancy (28% y-o-y), however, occupancy remains 8% down on pre-pandemic levels.. Sydney remained the largest transaction market nationally over 2023, recording total investment volumes in excess of AUD 640 million in CBD and fringe suburbs (across five deals). This included the landmark transaction and forward funding of the Waldorf Astoria Sydney development project and sale of The Old Clare Hotel.. Outlook: Ongoing market stabilisation anticipated throughout 2024. Sydney's ongoing market recovery remains dependent on the steady pick up in corporate and meetings demand, as well as the continued resurgence of international visitors. According to TRA's latest forecasts, Australia is anticipated to welcome 9.3 million inbound visitors in 2024 (98% of pre-pandemic levels), supported by the ongoing rebound of Australia's top pre-pandemic source market, China.. Despite current economic headwinds and the rise in borrowing costs, there continues to be strong investor appetite for Sydney hotels in what is a tightly held market. Currently, capital is primarily focused on targeting aspirational assets, be that trophy or strategic, and assets with value-add potential.. Note: Sydney Hotels refers to all grades of accommodation and includes both hotels and serviced apartments.. .  ",0

The KL office market underwent a robust recovery according to a JLL report, with the positive trend continuing following a significant increase in net absorptio How Kuala Lumpur's office market experienced a robust recovery. Find out which sectors drove the demand.. The KL office market underwent a robust recovery according to a JLL report, with the positive trend continuing following a significant increase in net absorption in the fourth quarter of 2023.. ""Occupancy rates and investor confidence all displayed an upward trajectory, indicating sustained growth and demand for office spaces. The ongoing positive momentum was remarkable and signified a favourable outlook for the office sector,"" the report added.. Here's more from JLL:. Financial services, insurance, IT and oil companies drove activity in the KL office market. These sectors played a crucial role in generating demand for office spaces, demonstrating their resilience and expansion plans. Tenants preferred high-quality office spaces, and flex space solutions gained popularity. Co-working spaces saw tenant expansion, and operators sought flexible options.. Vacant new completion and delays impact future projects. The latest addition to the market in the quarter was CT 5 @ Pavilion Damansara Heights, situated in the thriving KL Fringe submarket. This building offers a spacious 94,000 sq ft of space, making it an attractive location for businesses seeking prime office space in the area.. ESG-compliant spaces have higher demand than non-certified ones, reflecting the growing preference for sustainable and socially responsible buildings. This is driving an increasing supply of ESG-certified spaces and poses challenges for traditional spaces.. Dynamic rent growth observed in KLC and KLF submarkets. Demand-driven rent increases were observed in the quarter, with Kuala Lumpur (KLF) and Kuala Lumpur City (KLC) experiencing the highest upticks. Tenants are seizing the opportunity to relocate to newer, technologically-advanced buildings offering attractive rents.. Limited supply due to project delays, and the introduction of modern, ESG-compliant buildings like Menara Exchange 106 in TRX, drove rent growth. New sustainable spaces commanded higher rates, while older CBD buildings faced increased vacancies, leading to downward pressure on rents.. Outlook: Thriving office sector in KLC and KLF submarkets. The Kuala Lumpur office market is forecast to continue its robust recovery and sustain positive momentum, particularly in the KLC and KLF submarkets. These submarkets, known for their demand from financial services, insurance, IT and oil companies, are expected to play a significant role in driving the market's positive trajectory.. Key factors contributing to the market outlook include the preference for high-quality office spaces, the growing utilisation of flex space solutions, and the anticipated completion of delayed projects. Rent increases and tightening vacancy rates in certain submarkets further reinforce the positive market trajectory.. Note: Kuala Lumpur Office refers to Kuala Lumpur's Grade A office market.. .  ",0

In the fourth quarter of 2023, two hotels opened in Tokyo, among which was the 205-key Hotel Toranomon Hills – The Unbound Collection by Hyatt in December.. According to JLL, Tokyo Edition Ginza, the second Edition brand hotel in Tokyo, also opened in December. This luxury hotel added 86 keys to the market. This brought the upscale-to-above hotel supply to 22,633 keys at the end of December 2023.. Here's more from JLL:. Two other notable hotels are anticipated to enter the market by the end of the first quarter of 2024: Janu Tokyo and Hyatt House Tokyo Shibuya. These projects should bring 248 new rooms to Tokyo.. Tokyo's total visitor nights exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Japan recorded pent-up demand since the country reopened its borders to international travellers in October 2022, given that the weak Japanese yen has increased the destination's appeal. With continued improved airlift, Tokyo counted approximately 12 times the number of international visitor nights between January and October 2023, exceeding pre-pandemic levels by more than 34%.. Domestic demand remains strong amid increased international visitors, representing 60% of the total visitor nights in the city as of YTD October 2023, above 2019 levels by 16%.. RevPAR improves, supported by higher ADR. Tokyo registered a continued increase in trading performance in all hotel segments throughout the year. The rising number of tourists in the city has led to a significant improvement in average daily rate (ADR).. Following the trend through the third quarter of the year, hotels in Tokyo have registered high levels of ADR in the fourth quarter to offset a lagging occupancy rate due to airlift challenges. As a result, RevPAR continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels.. Outlook: Occupancy to catch up in 2024 despite some concerns. The strong travel momentum witnessed in Tokyo since 2023 is anticipated to continue in the middle term. As a result, occupancy in Tokyo hotels should pick up along with the increasing number of international tourists complementing a strong domestic demand base, whilst ADR is expected to rise slightly and then stabilise.. On the other hand, the earthquake in the Hokuriku region in January and anticipated future changes in exchange rate trends may affect the number of foreign visitors to Japan.. .

Image source: Kalkine Media. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 4, 2024) - ArcWest Exploration Inc. (TSXV: AWX) (""ArcWest"") is pleased to report results from the Company's comprehensive 2023 exploration program at its Todd Creek copper-gold (Cu-Au) project, located in BC's Golden Triangle (the ""Todd Creek project"").. ArcWest's 100% owned, 32,000 hectare Todd Creek project adjoins Newmont Corporation's recently acquired Brucejack Gold Mine property, one of the highest-grade operating gold mines in the world, and is located approximately 40 km southeast of Seabridge Gold's KSM-Iron Cap Cu-Au deposits, which are one of the largest Au-Cu concentrations in North America.. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program (geophysics, geological mapping and geochemical sampling), with an approved expenditure of up to $2.8 million, was funded by Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. (""Freeport""), as per an earn-in agreement announced March 10th, 2023 . An updated technical presentation for the Todd Creek project is available for download here .. Highlights. The 2023 Todd Creek program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in British Columbia history, completed by Dias Geophysics using their DIAS32 system. The IP survey focused on a 12 km N-S by 3 km E-W highly gossanous corridor on the west side of Todd Creek valley that is host to numerous Cu-Au occurrences over a widespread area. The survey delineated three extensive zones of high chargeability (25-45 mV-V) underlying or in proximity to areas of known Cu-Au mineralization on the property, including: (1) in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area, (2) west and north of historical drill holes in the Yellow Bowl Zone, and (3) west of the South Zone. The highest chargeabilities were located in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area where a 2 by 1 km zone (open to the north) wraps around a strong 300 by 800 metre conductor (low-resistivity zone). None of the high chargeability zones and conductors identified in the 2023 IP program have been drill tested.. Ice Creek Zone - six new rock samples along a 1 km long north-south trend returned gold values in excess of 1 g/t (grams per tonne), including a sample of hydrothermal breccia returning 262 g/t Au (with 2.46% Cu), one of the highest gold values seen to date on the project. Copper values within the trend range up to 3.43%. The Ice Creek Zone is underlain in part by a coincident chargeability (> 35 mV/V)/resistivity ( 30 mV/V) chargeability anomaly has been identified at depth to the west of epithermal Au-Cu lodes of the South Zone and newly recognized advanced argillic alteration ( Fig. 4 ). The chargeability anomaly is untested by drilling.. A new zone prospective for massive sulfides was discovered (South Ridge Zone) over two km west of the South Zone in a previously unexplored area. An area of QSP alteration over 2 km long contains massive sulfide lenses in siliceous sedimentary rocks overlying intensely QSP altered feldspar-porphyritic tuffs. Rock samples returned up to 3.96% Cu, with soil samples up to 296 ppm Cu.. Alteration mapping supported by TerraSpec analyses has defined extensive phyllic (muscovite) alteration over a north-south length of 13.5 km and across widths of 2-3.5 km, as well as a number of smaller structurally controlled zones of advanced argillic alteration (pyrophyllite, alunite, diaspore, dickite) in the Yellow Bowl Zone, Pyrophyllite Zone, and west of the South Zone.. Tyler Ruks, President and CEO of ArcWest commented, ""The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in B.C. history. The results of this combined geophysical, geological mapping and geochemical sampling program strengthen our thesis that the Todd Creek property is host to a very large and highly underexplored hydrothermal-magmatic system with potential for the discovery of multiple copper-gold mineralized centres. We are especially excited about the intense chargeability-resistivity anomalies identified at depth in the Ice Creek-Fall Creek areas, where Cu-Au mineralized intercepts in historic core contain previously unrecognized porphyry-like veins and recently recognized, vertically dipping Cu-Mo-Au mineralized breccia dikes contain potential intrusive clasts that have likely been sourced from depth.. ""ArcWest thanks the Todd Creek exploration crew, including Charlie Greig and his team, for their exceptional work on the project in 2023. Dias Geophysical deserves special credit for performing one of the most technically challenging geophysical surveys in B.C. history. We thank Freeport for funding such an aggressive ground program in 2023 and look forward to working with Freeport to advance the project in 2024.. ""Despite difficult market conditions, ArcWest remains in a strong financial position with just over $2 million hard dollars in the treasury, zero warrants, significant insider ownership and an exceptionally low burn rate. Anticipated income for ArcWest between now and the end of the year includes option payments totaling $900,000, in addition to share payments from earn-in agreements and operatorship fees for ArcWest managed exploration programs. The company currently has a market capitalization of only $4.15 million. Exploration budgets are being finalized, with potential for third-party funded drilling on multiple 100% ArcWest owned porphyry Cu-Au projects this year."". ArcWest's 2023 Todd Creek exploration program, funded by Freeport, was a comprehensive, multidisciplinary effort to delineate drill targets across multiple mineralized zones within the 12 kilometre-long Todd Creek alteration corridor. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration included:. Geophysics - completed a 6 by 2-3 kilometre 3D induced polarization (""IP"") survey, using Dias Geophysical's distributed array deep IP (""DCIP"") survey system.. Geology - Geological mapping completed over a 12 by 4 kilometre area on the west side of Todd Creek, with 2,021 geological stations.. Geochemistry - 256 rock samples, 458 soil/talus fine samples.. Hyperspectral - 676 rock samples and 458 soil sample pulps analyzed using a TerraSpec 3 hyperspectral analyzer to determine alteration mineralogy.. Petrography - 16 drill core samples from the South, Fall Creek and Orange Mountain Zones analyzed by an independent expert petrographer.. A brief summary of significant results for each mineralized zone is presented here. For more details on the 2023 program, including maps, photos and interpretations, a technical presentation for the Todd Creek project is available for download here .. Ice Creek and Fall Creek Zones. The Ice Creek and Fall Creek Zones are underlain primarily by variably altered (chlorite-epidote-pyrite through quartz-sericite-pyrite), locally K-feldspar rich mafic through intermediate/felsic volcanic rocks. Historical drilling in the Ice Creek and Fall Creek Zones included 35 drill holes over a 1.5 by 0.6 km area, with 19 testing high grade epithermal Au-Cu veins (primarily quartz-chalcopyrite-hematite) and breccias north of Fall Creek. Re-logging of select historic Ice Creek core by ArcWest geologists has demonstrated that Cu-Au mineralized intercepts locally contain previously unrecognized, porphyry-like veins. Historical drilling at Ice Creek-Fall Creek tested only shallow targets, with drill holes averaging 132 m in length. Shallow drill intercepts (not true widths) include:. 3.47 g/t Au and 0.73% Cu over 31.85m (88-22, Fall Creek ""A Zone"", 29.3-61.15m). 0.60 g/t Au and 0.25% Cu over 15.48m (NEZ07-01, Fall Creek ""B Zone"", 51.91-67.39m). 1.78 g/t Au",0

HIGHLIGHTSThis update incorporates results from recent drilling results carried out at Lady Julie North 4 (LJN4) since the last reso... Magnetic Resources NL. Overview. Magnetic Resources (ASX: MAU ) is an Australian company, developing a portfolio of significant gold projects in the established mining province, Laverton region, in Western Australia.. The company owns a 100-percent interest in the Hawks Nest and Lady Julie projects in Laverton, the Homeward Bound South project in Leonora, and the Benjabbering project in Julimar. The main deposits include Hawks Nest 9 (HN9), Lady Julie Central (LJC), Lady Julie North 4 (LJN4), Mount Jumbo and Homeward Bound South, which are all located in an area with well-endowed regional infrastructure, including three processing plants within 10 to 35 kilometres. These plants are owned by well-known operators including Goldfields Genesis/Dacian; Anglo-Ashanti; and Genesis/Dacian.. The projects' proximity to these existing processing facilities gives enough options to MAU for toll processing without having to invest millions of dollars in constructing its own processing plant.. Several large deposits such as Wallaby, Sunrise Dam and Jupiter Gold are in this jurisdiction. The company's projects are adjacent to some of these world-class deposits. The Mt Jumbo and Hawks Nest tenements are only 15 kilometres north of the Wallaby deposit. At both HN9 and Lady Julie, Magnetic Resources had identified multiple thickened stacked lodes near-surface, which have some similarities to Wallaby and Sunrise Dam.. LJN4, a key focus for the Laverton project, hosts thick breccia and silica pyrite zones up to 50 metres thick, which are also prevalent in Anglo Ashanti's world-class Sunrise Dam deposit, both parallel to near-surface breccia zones and vertical mineralization going downwards into several of their deposits. The Mau breccia zones often carry higher grades and are now being extended by new drilling at depth and further to the east and northeast, potentially growing the LJN4 resource.. In November 2023, the company announced a significant increase in the mineral resource estimates. The deposits in the Laverton and Homeward Bound area have seen a significant 107-percent increase over the last report in February 2023. The updated combined mineral resources estimate for the whole project area stands at 22.7 million tonnes (Mt) @ 1.69 grams per ton (g/t) gold totaling 1.24 million ounces (Moz) of gold at 0.5 g/t cutoff.. LJN4 is now, by far, the largest resource in the project area, as its contained gold rose from 204,000 oz to 852,000 oz, a 317-percent increase. Extension drilling continues and is expected to result in further resource increases.. The significance of LJN4's gold resource has not gone unnoticed, as research firm Argonaut has called it a ‘ sleeping giant ,' noting recent drilling at LJN4 ""indicates a significant discovery unfolding in the Laverton region."" If MAU can replicate the recent drilling intercepts, the next resource update at LNJ4 could easily make it a 1-Moz deposit. This will position LJN4 as one of the best undeveloped gold assets in the Laverton region.. Company Highlights. Magnetic Resources (MAU) is an Australian company focused on gold development projects in Western Australia.. The company owns a 100-percent-interest in the Hawks Nest and Lady Julie projects in Laverton, the Homeward Bound South project in Leonora, and the Benjabbering project in Julimar.. MAU's large tenement positions in the Leonora and Laverton districts of Western Australia, are near numerous large deposits with existing mining operations and good infrastructure.. The presence of three processing plants close to MAU's Laverton deposits provides scope for toll processing.. In November 2023, the company announced a 107-percent increase in the resource estimate for Laverton and Homeward Bound South deposits. The revised resource stands at 22.7 Mt @ 1.69 g/t gold totaling 1.24 Moz of gold at 0.5 g/t cutoff.. For the Laverton project deposits - Lady Julie North 4,Lady Julie Central and Hawks Nest 9 - early work programs, including project environmental, heritage and technical background studies, are close to completion. The aim is to submit a mining proposal in January 2024.. In October 2023, the company announced the completion of a AU$4.8-million private placement . The company is now fully funded with AU$7 million cash to aggressively advance to the next stage of development.. The company's highly experienced senior leadership team has a proven track record to capitalize on the high resource potential of its projects.. Key Projects. Laverton Projects. MAU has 179 sq. kilometres. of prospective exploration tenements in the Laverton region comprising three main deposits - Hawks Nest 9 (HN9), Lady Julie Central (LJC) and Lady Julie North 4 (LJN4). All are 100-percent-owned tenements and within 20 to 30 kilometres of three major gold camps collectively hosting more than 25 Moz of gold resource - Granny Smith (owned by Goldfields Australia), Jupiter (owned by Dacian Gold) and Sunrise Dam (owned by AngloGold Ashanti). In the Laverton Project, extensive drilling programs have been completed with 1,898 RC/DD holes for 147,943 metres with further deeper drilling now planned.. MAU's updated resource estimate stands at 10.4 Mt indicated @ 1.74 g/t gold containing 584,400 oz and 12.2 Mt inferred @ 1.65 g/t gold containing 651,300 oz for a total of 22.7 Mt @ 1.69 g/t gold, containing 1.24 Moz at 0.5g/t cutoff. The depth of drilling averages only 79 metres on all projects. Note that these estimates include the Homeward Bound South project as well. The discovery cost for all these resources is very low at $24/ounce.. Early work programs have begun at these deposits and all approvals are expected by December 2023. MAU aims to submit a mining proposal to DMIRS in late January 2024. Blue Cap Mining is helping with all key approvals and assessing the economics of the Laverton Project.. Hawks Nest 9: The HN9 (indicated and inferred) resource is estimated at 3.2 Mt at 1.22 g/t gold for 123,000 oz contained within three main zones within a 2-kilometre by 200-metre-wide area and is largely within the indicated category (63 percent). Widespread surface and shallow east-dipping lodes are present in the project area.. Lady Julie Central: The Lady Julie Central (indicated and inferred) resource is estimated at 1.33 Mt at 1.68 g/t gold for 72,200 oz, covering a 350-metre by 200-metre area. Nearly 59 percent of the resource falls in the indicated category.. Lady Julie North 4: LJN4 is by far the largest resource in the project area. The resource (indicated and inferred) is estimated at 13.1 Mt at 2.20 g/t gold for 852,000 oz, covering an 800-metre by 200-metre area, and is open down dip and to the east, which augers well for the potential size. This resource is partly in the indicated category (52 percent). Thick breccia silica pyrite intersections have now been outlined over a 250-metre length in the central and southern part of LJN4, which are very similar to that found in the world-class Sunrise Dam deposit. These zones containing drilling holes (MLJRC789, MLJRC779 and MLJRC679) are now being extended by new drilling at depth and further to the east and northeast. This provides strong potential to grow the LJN4 resource. A 1,390-metre diamond and a 2,555-metre RC program have started and will be scoping out extensions both to the east and northeast with holes planned between 400-metre to 550-metre depth ",0

The commercial investm. Singapore has taken the lead in Asia-Pacific in commercial real estate investments in Q4 2023, according to Knight Frank's latest report. The commercial investm Singapore beats all other APAC cities with USD4.1b commercial property investments in Q4. This is the highest quarterly figure in the last five years.. Singapore has taken the lead in Asia-Pacific in commercial real estate investments in Q4 2023, according to Knight Frank's latest report. The commercial investment volume in Singapore grew 462% quarterly and 110% over the same year, to reach USD 4.1 billion. This is the highest Q4 figure recorded in the last five years, surpassing the average quarterly increase of USD 2.5 billion by 64%, and placing Singapore at the forefront of the region.. These gains were driven by several substantial office transactions, including Shenton House (USD 402 million), VisionCrest (USD 322 million), and Wilkie Edge (USD 260 billion).. Christine Li, head of research, Asia-Pacific, Knight Frank elaborates, ""The deals occurred despite the weaker investor sentiments due to fluctuations in interest rate movements and diverging expectations between buyer and seller on asset valuations. The successful execution of these large-scale transactions highlights the underlying strength of Singapore's commercial real estate market. It also suggests that as interest rates stabilise and repricing slows, pent-up demand for office assets may drive recovery for the sector by the end of 2024."". Neil Brookes, global head of capital markets, Knight Frank, highlights the encouraging developments for the commercial real estate market in the coming months. ""The Q4 figures and ongoing transactions in early 2024 suggest improving investor sentiment. Despite challenges such as tight yield spreads and high borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve maintained steady interest rates in the January 2024 meeting while advising against a rate cut in March. Our outlook anticipates rate cuts to occur after mid-year 2024, which is likely to coincide with a more active investment market."". South Korea's commercial real estate investment volume bounces back, led by strategic investors and tight office market dynamics. South Korea's commercial real estate investment volume rebounded significantly in Q4 2023, reaching approximately USD 6.5 billion, a 52.6% increase from Q4 2022. This recovery was primarily driven by strategic investors taking advantage of the tight supply-demand dynamics in the office sector, which remained the preferred asset type.. Ms Li explains, ""Seoul's office market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with office rents increasing more than 17% since 2020 and vacancy rates compressing to less than 1%. This strong performance has positioned it as the best-performing office market in Asia. Traditionally, South Korean institutional investors have been among the most well-capitalised players in the regional commercial real estate market. However, their activity has slowed recently due to liquidity constraints and the prolonged high-interest rate environment. Additionally, overseas acquisitions have faced challenges such as valuation declines resulting from quick repricing, muted demand for occupier spaces, and refinancing issues."". Overall, Seoul's office market continues to attract strong investor interest despite the challenges posed by limited supply and high demand. Strategic investors play a crucial role in reshaping the market as they acquire properties for self-use and address occupier issues. On the other hand, the retail sector also saw upticks in investment volume, improving sevenfold from Q4 2022.. Asia-Pacific multi-family sector clinched a stellar performance. The Asia-Pacific multi-family sector recorded a stellar performance in 2023. In the last ten years, the Asia-Pacific multi-family sector attracted a total investment of USD 75.5 billion, with 2023 accounting for 14% of that figure. This trend highlights its attractiveness to investors seeking defensive strategies and reliable income streams in a changing market environment.. Emily Relf, head of living sectors, Asia-Pacific, Knight Frank, adds, ""As the sector gains more attention in the region, investors have uncovered more opportunities beyond Japan, which has traditionally been the most well-established multi-family market in the region. In 2023, investment volume diversified, with more transactions occurring in markets such as Australia, Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong SAR.. Australia's multi-family sector has seen full-year transaction volumes increasing seven folds from US$ 1.14 billion in 2022 to US$ 1.96 billion in 2023. Strong population growth, a large tenant base, and a severe housing supply shortage, coupled with a deep and liquid investment market, position Australia's multifamily sector for strategic growth and institutional investment."". With strong population growth contributing to a large market of tenants and a severe lack of housing supply, combined with a deep and liquid investment market, the Australian multi-family market is strategically positioned to establish itself as the next primary institutional asset class.. The Chinese Mainland multi-family market also holds significant potential, with 2023 transaction volume nearly doubling to US$ 1.96 billion, almost twice from the previous year. Factors such as rural-urban migration, demographic shifts, and the slowdown in the property market are driving a stronger inclination towards renting, and presents opportunities for the nascent multi-family sector.. .

Im Hintergrund verfolgte die Damenmannschaft des SV DJK Kolbermoor das zweite Einzel von Naomi Pranjkovic, die Alina Nikitchanka in fünf Sätzen bezwang. Foto: Gerhard Erlich. Kolbermoor – In den vergangenen neun Spielen haben Kolbermoors Bundesliga-Tischtennisdamen fünfmal 5:5 Unentschieden gespielt.. In der zehnten Begegnung, nämlich im Oberbayernderby gegen den TSV Dachau 65, das mit dem gleichen Ergebnis endete und 250 Minuten andauerte, teilten sich beide Mannschaften ebenfalls die Punkte.. Es war aber wohl eine der besten Begegnungen, die das Team um Betreuerin Krisztina Toth – sie vertrat den verhinderten Trainer Michael Fuchs – in dieser Saison ablieferte.. Die Eingangsdoppel vor leider nur 130 Zuschauern endeten einmal mehr unentschieden, wobei das Duo Lang/Tiefenbrunner Dachaus Spitzendoppel Winter/Liu zumindest über vier Sätze Paroli bieten konnte und erst im Entscheidungssatz nach dem 0:4 Rückstand einbrach und mit 2:11 verlor.. Im ersten Einzeldurchgang lief es zunächst nicht unbedingt nach Wunsch, wenngleich Kristin Lang gegen Yangzi Liu drauf und dran war, ihrer Gegnerin die erste Niederlage beizubringen. Im fünften Satz wechselte man aus Sicht der Kolbermoorerin beim Stand von 4:5 die Seiten. Von da an baute aber die Chinesin ihren Vorsprung immer weiter aus und schickte Lang mit einem 11:4 von der Platte.. Hana Arapovic ging es gegen Sabine Winter nicht besser, wenngleich die Begegnung hier nur vier Durchgänge andauerte.. Als  im hinteren Paarkreuz auch nichts Zählbares zustande kam, obwohl beispielsweise Swastika Ghosh bei der Viersatzniederlage gegen Alina Nikitchanka dreimal jeweils in der Anfangsphase der einzelnen Sätze führte und es trotzdem 1:5 aus heimischer Sicht stand, deutete vieles auf ein schnelles Ende hin.. Kolbermoors stellvertretender Abteilungsleiter Günther Lodes hatte das Spiel ebenfalls schon abgehakt und gedacht: ""Jetzt ist es aus"".. Das aber wollten die Damen doch nicht auf sich sitzen lassen und die erste Spielerin, die die Zügel anzog, war Kristin Lang. In dem ewig jungen Duell gegen Sabine Winter musste sie im Gegensatz zur Vorrunde als ihr ein 3:0 Sieg gelang, in den Entscheidungssatz gehen. In diesem wechselte man nach der 5:2 Führung für Lang die Seiten. Eine kurze Schwächephase führte dazu, dass Winter auf 7:6 herankam und ein Timeout der Kolbermoorerin zur Folge hatte. Lang schaffte im Anschluss eine 10:6 Führung und verwertete den ersten Matchball zum 11:6.. Dieser Punkt zum 2:5 war dann der Auftakt für eine furiose Aufholjagd.. Hana Arapovic gelang es, auch wenn sie in den Entscheidungssatz gehen musste, Yangzi Liu die erste Rückrundenniederlage beizubringen. Interessant dabei, dass sie beim Seitenwechsel noch mit 3:5 im Hintertreffen lag, konsequent aber weiter spielte und in der Endphase sogar mit 10:8 in Führung lag. Bei eigenem Aufschlag holte sie sich den letzten Punkt.. Die Neuverpflichtung Swastika Ghosh, die sich erstmals dem heimischen Publikum vorstellte, verkürzte sogar auf 4:5. Für die Krönung sorgte letztendlich aber Naomi Pranjkovic. Gegen die Abwehrspezialistin Alina Nikitchanka absolvierte sie ihr bislang wohl bestes Einzel in dieser Saison und lag verdient mit 2:0 Sätzen in Führung. Man ging allerdings in den fünften Satz, in dem Pranjkovic beim Seitenwechsel noch mit 5:4 führte, dann aber plötzlich mit 8:10 in Rückstand geriet. Mit einer Niederlage wollte sie sich aber nicht abfinden, glich zum 10:10 aus und gewann in einer irren Schlussphase der Verlängerung noch mit 14:12.. Nicht nur der Mannschaft, sondern auch Krisztina Toth fiel ein wahrer Felsbrocken vom Herzen. Sie meinte später: ""Ich denke, Dachau dürfte sich etwas geärgert haben, nachdem sie schon mit 5:1 geführt hatten. Als Hana Arapovic gewonnen hatte, dachte ich mir schon, dass es Unentschieden ausgehen könnte. Ich denke, es ist ein gutes und für uns verdientes Ergebnis"".. Für den SV DJK Kolbermoor punkteten:.

Kolbermoor – Fast drei Stunden haben Kolbermoors Bundesliga-Tischtennisdamen dem Tabellenführer TTC Weinheim Paroli geboten.. Am Ende standen sie nach einer unglücklichen 2:6 Niederlage mit leeren Händen da.. Krisztina Toth, die einmal mehr Trainer Michael Fuchs vertrat, hatte die Doppel so aufgestellt, dass man hoffen durfte, zumindest einen Punkt zu ergattern.. Dies gelang dann auch Swastika Ghosh und ihrer Partnerin Hana Arapovic, die das Duo Wan/Klee in vier Sätzen zwar knapp aber am Ende doch verdient niederringen konnten.. Die Einzel nahmen allesamt aus Kolbermoorer Sicht einen unglücklichen Verlauf. So schaffte es beispielsweise Kristin Lang gegen Yuan Wan im vierten Satz, einen 3:7 Rückstand in einen 11:7 Sieg umzumünzen. Im Entscheidungssatz, der fällig war, führte sie beim Seitenwechsel noch mit 5:4, geriet dann aber in Rückstand und verlor mit 7:11.. Hana Arapovic hatte Weinheims Spitzenspielerin Bruna Takahashi gut im Griff, wenngleich es der Brasilianerin gelang, zum 2:2 Satzausgleich zu kommen. Der fünfte Satz verlief für die Kroatin zunächst durchwachsen, was beim Seitenwechsel einen 1:5 Rückstand zur Folge hatte. Die 19-Jährige schien aber Oberwasser zu bekommen, als sie trotz eines zwischenzeitlichen Timeout ihrer Gegnerin zum 7:7 ausgleichen konnte. In der Schlussphase stand ihr das Glück nicht zur Seite, was darin gipfelte, dass Takahashi die Begegnung mit einem sogenannten Netzroller zum 11:7 beendete.. Ein ähnliches Bild sahen die etwa 110 Zuschauer im hinteren Paarkreuz – insbesondere bei Swastika Ghosh. Die Inderin führe gegen Sophia Klee eigentlich recht sicher mit 2:0 Sätzen, lief aber in Durchgang Nummer drei lange einem Rückstand nach. Nach dem 9:9 hatte sie mit zwei Bällen etwas Pech, was zum 9:11 führte. Die Folge war – nachdem sie im vierten Satz mit 1:11 das Nachsehen hatte – der Entscheidungssatz, der beim Seitenwechsel einen 3:5 Rückstand von Ghosh sah. Mit einer überaus engagierten Energieleistung schaffte sie den Anschluss zum 9:10 und musste letztlich aber den Punkt zum 9:11 hinnehmen.. Nach Laura Tiefenbrunners Dreisatzniederlage gegen Mateja Jeger stand es 1:5 aus Kolbermoorer Sicht. Diese Zwischenstände hatte man in einigen Spielen der Vergangenheit erfolgreich abgewendet und zumindest ein Unentschieden erreicht.. Kristin Lang schien dieses schwierige Unterfangen erfolgreich gestalten zu können. Denn im Topduell gegen Bruna Takahashi musste sie zwar auch in den Entscheidungssatz gehen, führte aber beim Seitenwechsel mit 5:1. Diesen Vorsprung baute sie bis auf 10:5 aus und setzte sich mit 11:5 durch.. Aber Hana Arapovic gelang es nicht, Yuan Wan in die Knie zu zwingen. In einem Spiel auf Augenhöhe, das über drei Sätze ging, entschieden Kleinigkeiten, wobei aber Arapovic immer wieder das Nachsehen hatte und die Sätze mit 11:13/9:11/8:11 verlor.. ""Es waren heute einige unglückliche Situationen, wie Netz- und Kantenbälle, dabei. Und wenn dir da nichts gelingt, bist du in dieser Klasse gleich hinten"", stellte Kolbermoors stellvertretender Abteilungsleiter Günther Lodes fest, der nichts dagegen gehabt hätte, wenn eines der anfänglichen drei Fünfsatzspiele auf die heimische Seite gefallen wäre..

After a successful opening weekend for the baseball season in Oklahoma and three wins in four games, the Sooners hit the road and headed to Sin City for the Baseball in Oklahoma: Visit Mondy Hill. March 4, 2024. by Vaseline. After a successful opening weekend for the baseball season in Oklahoma and three wins in four games, the Sooners hit the road and headed to Sin City for the first Las Vegas College Baseball Classic.. The Sooners posted a 5-3 record in Vegas, including a victory over then-top-10 team Tennessee in the Shriners Children's College Showdown on the opening weekend of the season.. Unfortunately, OU came up empty-handed in Las Vegas.  The Sooners fell to Pittsburgh in the tournament opener in the first ever meeting on the baseball diamond between OU and the Panthers.  On Sunday, the Sooners led entering the ninth inning, but were unable to maintain it.  They lost 4-3 to Ohio State and dropped to 5-5 on the season.. The Saturday night game against California would be canceled due to bad weather.. Let's take a walk to the mound and see how the Sooners pitching staff fared in Vegas.. Pittsburgh 19, Oklahoma 9. Junior left-handed Brad Davis was spectacular against Wright State last Friday, unfortunately the transfer from Sam Houston State had a hard time against Pittsburgh.  Davis only lasted two innings.  He faced 12 batters and threw 62 pitches, allowing seven runs on five hits.  He recorded four strikeouts, but also issued four free passes.. The Sooners, forced into the bullpen early, used seven more pitchers against Pittsburgh, none of whom lasted more than an inning.  Collectively, the seven relievers who followed Davis to the mound — Dylan Crooks, Jett Lodes, Carter Carmichael, Reid Hensley, Carson Atwood, Brad Pruett And Grant Stevens — gave up 12 extra runs (nine earned), 11 hits, six strikeouts and eight bases on ball.. For the game, the Sooners' pitching staff scored a total of 16 earned runs on 16 hits, walked 12 and recorded 10 outs via strikeout.  All in all a very poor performance with Davis taking the loss, his first of the season.. Ohio State 4, Oklahoma 3. Right-handed starter Brendan Girton took the mound for the Sooners against the Ohio State Buckeyes on Sunday.  The Texas Tech transfer lasted just two innings, allowing two runs on three hits, striking out three and walking one (47 pitches).  He also hit a batter in his two innings of work.. Fortunately, the Sooners didn't have to go as deep into the bullpen on Sunday.  Senior left-hander James Hitt entered the game in the third inning.  He worked 3.1 scoreless innings, allowing just two hits, striking out four and walking one.  Sophomore right-handed Kyson Witherspoon worked the final 3.1 innings and gave up the two runs in the ninth inning, erasing a 3-2 Oklahoma lead and proving to be the winning margin for the Buckeyes.. Witherspoon took the loss for the Sooners.  Kyson's brother Malachi came in and recorded the last of the ninth, striking out the lone batter he faced on seven pitches.. It wasn't the best pitching performance from Oklahoma's staff, but it was much better than Friday's game against Pittsburgh.  Against the Buckeyes, the Sooners gave up four runs (three earned) on nine hits, posted a dozen strikeouts and walked five.. After a tough weekend in Vegas, the Sooners return home for their first Big 12 game of the season, a three-game weekend series at L. Dale Mitchell Park against Central Florida (UCF)..

Intra Energy Corporation Ltd (ASX:IEC) has received multiple high-grade gold results of up to 17.8 g/t from a mapping and rock sampling program at the Intra Energy Corp has hit high-grade gold in sampling at Maggie Hays Hill. Posted on. by Sonia. Intra Energy Corporation Ltd (ASX:IEC) has received multiple high-grade gold results of up to 17.8 g/t from a mapping and rock sampling program at the recently acquired Maggie Hays Hill project, which is prospective for lithium, nickel and gold in the Lake Johnston region in Western Australia.. The company has identified two separate gold deposit systems, both of which are open along and at depth.. ""The identification of surface gold mineralization in quartz veins outcropping at the Maggie Hays Hill project adds to an existing compelling lithium exploration plan to create shareholder value.  IEC intends to vigorously pursue both goals,"" said Intra Energy CEO Ben Dunn.. Results of rock sample testing.. Gold in quartz veins Identified at surface. Intra Energy conducted mapping and rock sampling in early February, identifying high-grade gold mineralization associated with quartz veins within basalt at two locations in the southern portion of the residential building.. Rock chip samples were collected along historically identified trends specifically from exposed quartz veins and vein walls.. Explored gold targets include historical exploration on the west side of Maggie Hay Hill where a five-hole RC drill program identified 2 meters at 11 g/t gold, 1 meter at 1.7 g/t and 3 meters at 1.7 g/t.  Further research here was planned but never completed.. On the east side of Maggie Hays Hill (East lode) a 118 meter historic RC hole intersected 7 meters grading 0.48 g/t gold, including 1 meter grading 1.5 g/tu mafic volcanic rocks.  Gold is associated with disseminated sulfides and quartz.. Two separate gold lodes (East and West) have been defined — each over 130 meters, trending north-south approximately parallel to the stratigraphy.  It is important that both lodes are open along the north and south about 300 meters in both directions.. A review of the 2021 soil sampling results identified several areas of gold anomalism along the string that were not monitored.. Further work is planned. The high grade gold results in the West Deposit, East Deposit and the wider gold anomaly identified in the 2021 soil program will be followed up with infill soil sampling and field mapping to identify the scale of mineralization and test several historically identified anomalies that have never been graded.. An overview of the gold mineralization area showing rock sampling results, vein trends and potential mineralization extensions..  ",0

LinkedIn X (ex-Twitter) WhatsApp Telegram Copier. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 4, 2024) - ArcWest Exploration Inc. (TSXV: AWX) (""ArcWest"") is pleased to report results from the Company's comprehensive 2023 exploration program at its Todd Creek copper-gold (Cu-Au) project, located in BC's Golden Triangle (the ""Todd Creek project"").. ArcWest's 100% owned, 32,000 hectare Todd Creek project adjoins Newmont Corporation's recently acquired Brucejack Gold Mine property, one of the highest-grade operating gold mines in the world, and is located approximately 40 km southeast of Seabridge Gold's KSM-Iron Cap Cu-Au deposits, which are one of the largest Au-Cu concentrations in North America.. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program (geophysics, geological mapping and geochemical sampling), with an approved expenditure of up to $2.8 million, was funded by Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. (""Freeport""), as per an earn-in agreement announced March 10th, 2023.  An updated technical presentation for the Todd Creek project is available for download here.. Highlights. The 2023 Todd Creek program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in British Columbia history, completed by Dias Geophysics using their DIAS32 system.  The IP survey focused on a 12 km N-S by 3 km E-W highly gossanous corridor on the west side of Todd Creek valley that is host to numerous Cu-Au occurrences over a widespread area.  The survey delineated three extensive zones of high chargeability (25-45 mV-V) underlying or in proximity to areas of known Cu-Au mineralization on the property, including: (1) in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area, (2) west and north of historical drill holes in the Yellow Bowl Zone, and (3) west of the South Zone. The highest chargeabilities were located in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area where a 2 by 1 km zone (open to the north) wraps around a strong 300 by 800 metre conductor (low-resistivity zone). None of the high chargeability zones and conductors identified in the 2023 IP program have been drill tested.. Ice Creek Zone - six new rock samples along a 1 km long north-south trend returned gold values in excess of 1 g/t (grams per tonne), including a sample of hydrothermal breccia returning 262 g/t Au (with 2.46% Cu), one of the highest gold values seen to date on the project. Copper values within the trend range up to 3.43%. The Ice Creek Zone is underlain in part by a coincident chargeability (> 35 mV/V)/resistivity (. Fig. 1).. Fall Creek Zone - prospecting located a breccia dyke between the A and B zones which returned an assay of 1.15 g/t Au, 0.76% Cu and 80 parts per million molybdenum (Mo). Rock samples from the south side of Fall Creek returned assays of 0.039-3.21 g/t Au, 0.31-3.67% Cu and 2.6-22.5 g/t silver (Ag) in an area with only one shallow drill hole.  The 2023 geophysical survey has identified a largely untested chargeability anomaly underlying much of the Fall Creek area (Fig. 2).. Yellow Bowl - Multiple untested chargeability anomalies have been identified beneath variably Cu-Au mineralized, predominantly quartz-sericite-pyrite altered volcanic rocks of the Yellow Bowl target area (Fig. 3).  3D IP results suggest that 2020 drill holes at Yellow Bowl did not test the chargeability anomalies.. South Zone - A significant (> 30 mV/V) chargeability anomaly has been identified at depth to the west of epithermal Au-Cu lodes of the South Zone and newly recognized advanced argillic alteration (Fig. 4).  The chargeability anomaly is untested by drilling.. A new zone prospective for massive sulfides was discovered (South Ridge Zone) over two km west of the South Zone in a previously unexplored area. An area of QSP alteration over 2 km long contains massive sulfide lenses in siliceous sedimentary rocks overlying intensely QSP altered feldspar-porphyritic tuffs. Rock samples returned up to 3.96% Cu, with soil samples up to 296 ppm Cu.. Alteration mapping supported by TerraSpec analyses has defined extensive phyllic (muscovite) alteration over a north-south length of 13.5 km and across widths of 2-3.5 km, as well as a number of smaller structurally controlled zones of advanced argillic alteration (pyrophyllite, alunite, diaspore, dickite) in the Yellow Bowl Zone, Pyrophyllite Zone, and west of the South Zone.. Tyler Ruks, President and CEO of ArcWest commented, ""The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in B.C. history.  The results of this combined geophysical, geological mapping and geochemical sampling program strengthen our thesis that the Todd Creek property is host to a very large and highly underexplored hydrothermal-magmatic system with potential for the discovery of multiple copper-gold mineralized centres.  We are especially excited about the intense chargeability-resistivity anomalies identified at depth in the Ice Creek-Fall Creek areas, where Cu-Au mineralized intercepts in historic core contain previously unrecognized porphyry-like veins and recently recognized, vertically dipping Cu-Mo-Au mineralized breccia dikes contain potential intrusive clasts that have likely been sourced from depth.. ""ArcWest thanks the Todd Creek exploration crew, including Charlie Greig and his team, for their exceptional work on the project in 2023.  Dias Geophysical deserves special credit for performing one of the most technically challenging geophysical surveys in B.C. history.  We thank Freeport for funding such an aggressive ground program in 2023 and look forward to working with Freeport to advance the project in 2024.. ""Despite difficult market conditions, ArcWest remains in a strong financial position with just over $2 million hard dollars in the treasury, zero warrants, significant insider ownership and an exceptionally low burn rate.  Anticipated income for ArcWest between now and the end of the year includes option payments totaling $900,000, in addition to share payments from earn-in agreements and operatorship fees for ArcWest managed exploration programs.  The company currently has a market capitalization of only $4.15 million.  Exploration budgets are being finalized, with potential for third-party funded drilling on multiple 100% ArcWest owned porphyry Cu-Au projects this year."". ArcWest's 2023 Todd Creek exploration program, funded by Freeport, was a comprehensive, multidisciplinary effort to delineate drill targets across multiple mineralized zones within the 12 kilometre-long Todd Creek alteration corridor. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration included:. Geophysics - completed a 6 by 2-3 kilometre 3D induced polarization (""IP"") survey, using Dias Geophysical's distributed array deep IP (""DCIP"") survey system.. Geology - Geological mapping completed over a 12 by 4 kilometre area on the west side of Todd Creek, with 2,021 geological stations.. Geochemistry - 256 rock samples, 458 soil/talus fine samples.. Hyperspectral - 676 rock samples and 458 soil sample pulps analyzed using a TerraSpec 3 hyperspectral analyzer to determine alteration mineralogy.. Petrography - 16 drill core samples from the South, Fall Creek and Orange Mountain Zones analyzed by an independent expert petrographer..

View Intra Energy Corporation Ltd. ASX:IEC. Intra Energy Corporation Ltd (ASX:IEC) has received multiple high-grade gold results of up to 17.8 g/t from a mapping and rock sampling program at the recently acquired Maggie Hays Hill Project, which is prospective for lithium, nickel and gold in the Lake Johnston region of Western Australia.. The company identified two separate gold lode systems, both of which are open along strike and at depth.. ""The identification of gold mineralisation at surface in outcropping quartz veins at the Maggie Hays Hill Project adds to the existing compelling lithium exploration plan to generate shareholder value. IEC intends to follow up both targets with vigour,"" said Intra Energy managing director Ben Dunn.. Rock sample assay results.. Gold in quartz veins Identified at surface. Intra Energy conducted mapping and rock sampling in early February, identifying high-grade gold mineralisation associated with quartz veining within basalts at two locations in the southern part of the tenement.. Rock chip samples were collected along historically identified trends specifically from the exposed quartz veins and vein walls.. The gold targets investigated include historical exploration on the western side of Maggie Hay Hill where a five-hole RC drilling program identified 2 metres at 11 g/t gold, 1 metre at 1.7 g/t and 3 metres at 1.7 g/t. Further exploration here was planned but never completed.. On the eastern side of Maggie Hays Hill (east lode) a historical 118-metre RC hole intersected 7 metres at 0.48 g/t gold including 1 metre at 1. 5 g/t in mafic volcanic rocks. The gold is associated with disseminated sulphides and quartz.. Two separate gold lodes (east and west) have been defined — each over 130 metres, trending north-south roughly parallel with stratigraphy. Importantly, both lodes are open along strike to the north and south for around 300 metres in both directions.. A review of the 2021 soil sampling results identified several areas of gold anomalism along strike that have not been followed up.. Follow-up work planned. The high-grade gold results at the west lode, east lode and the broader gold anomalism identified in the 2021 soil program will be followed up with infill soil sampling and field mapping to identify the scale of mineralisation and to test several historically identified anomalies that were never evaluated..

""The identification of gold mineralisation at surface in outcropping quartz veins at the Maggie Hays Hill Project adds to the existing compelling lithium exploration plan to generate shareholder value. IEC intends to follow up both targets with vigour,"" said Intra Energy managing director Ben Dunn.. Rock sample assay results.. Gold in quartz veins Identified at surface. Intra Energy conducted mapping and rock sampling in early February, identifying high-grade gold mineralisation associated with quartz veining within basalts at two locations in the southern part of the tenement.. Rock chip samples were collected along historically identified trends specifically from the exposed quartz veins and vein walls.. The gold targets investigated include historical exploration on the western side of Maggie Hay Hill where a five-hole RC drilling program identified 2 metres at 11 g/t gold, 1 metre at 1.7 g/t and 3 metres at 1.7 g/t. Further exploration here was planned but never completed.. On the eastern side of Maggie Hays Hill (east lode) a historical 118-metre RC hole intersected 7 metres at 0.48 g/t gold including 1 metre at 1. 5 g/t in mafic volcanic rocks. The gold is associated with disseminated sulphides and quartz.. Two separate gold lodes (east and west) have been defined — each over 130 metres, trending north-south roughly parallel with stratigraphy. Importantly, both lodes are open along strike to the north and south for around 300 metres in both directions.. A review of the 2021 soil sampling results identified several areas of gold anomalism along strike that have not been followed up.. Follow-up work planned. The high-grade gold results at the west lode, east lode and the broader gold anomalism identified in the 2021 soil program will be followed up with infill soil sampling and field mapping to identify the scale of mineralisation and to test several historically identified anomalies that were never evaluated..

An expert also recommended utilising BMS for data analysis, empowering stakeholders to pinpoint energy-saving opportunities..  Older office buildings adopt open protocol systems for energy management. Experts also point to usage of building management systems for energy-saving opportunities.. Office building owners in Singapore are increasingly turning to open protocol systems for energy management to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact.. Samuel Han, head of Energy Sustainability Management at Savills Singapore, said owners can seamlessly integrate new energy systems with older infrastructure by leveraging open protocols, which facilitate easy connections between equipment as long as application programming interface connections are permitted.. ""For energy systems, recently they are all open protocol,"" he told the Singapore Business Review.. Open protocols, openly published and accessible to all, are supported by various entities including corporations, user groups, professional societies, and governments. This support broadens users' options for devices or systems tailored to their specific needs, as per a Schneider Electric report.. In building management systems (BMS), open protocols provide benefits such as widespread support from manufacturers and software vendors, availability of diverse third-party software, streamlined communication with subsystems, active community support, and future adaptability.. Amidst the challenges posed by old buildings, Han said their inherent efficiency often yields significant returns once modernised, making them prime candidates for energy-saving upgrades.. ""For older buildings, they have greater benefits of installing the energy systems, because they will have higher payback. This is due to greater energy savings as older buildings tend to be less efficient,"" he said.. Building Management Systems. Additionally, Han recommended utilising BMS for data analysis, empowering stakeholders to pinpoint energy-saving opportunities.. BMS are integral systems designed to control and monitor crucial energy-consuming components within buildings, including HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), lighting levels, and security systems.. The expert also underscored the importance of addressing energy consumption, particularly attributed to HVAC systems, which can account for up to 70% of energy bills.. ""We have to tackle that equipment to make it more efficient, and for an inefficient building to become an efficient building, it could save them 30% to 50% of the energy bills,"" he said.. For Han, the key lies in a comprehensive approach that integrates regular maintenance protocols for essential equipment in plant rooms alongside sophisticated data tracking mechanisms, often supported by artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.. He said the transformation in the landscape of energy management in office buildings, where AI assists with fault detection and provides automated solutions, reduces manual labour.. New technologies. Office building owners have also increasingly embraced innovative technologies.. ""The multi-comparison chiller, which operates efficiently under low occupancy levels, and IoT sensors that enhance data collection and analysis, have become increasingly popular,"" Han said.. The expert also pointed out the importance of educating tenants on conservation through targeted initiatives.. ""And from there, we can analyze and see where the shortfall is or where the low-hanging fruits are. They can do energy retrofits to better save their energy, and also to educate the tenants on energy and water savings by sticking posters on the walls, to educate them better on the importance of the environment,"" he said.. ""Awareness and understanding of energy data are key to identifying savings opportunities, and tenant education can foster a culture of sustainability,"" Han advised.. Singapore's commitment to optimising energy consumption and reducing environmental impact is evident through initiatives such as adopting solar photovoltaic systems and pursuing green building certifications like BCA's Green. Mark and LEED, alongside data-driven energy management, optimised HVAC systems, and efficient water and lighting usage.. In 2005, the Green Mark certification scheme was introduced to evaluate buildings' environmental impact and performance, promoting sustainable design and construction practices.. Sustainable energy strategy. Singapore has made significant progress in reducing its carbon footprint by transitioning from carbon-intensive fuel oil to natural gas for electricity generation.. At present, natural gas accounts for over 95% of Singapore's fuel mix for electricity generation due to its lower carbon content per unit of electricity produced, according to the National Environment Agency.. Singapore aims to escalate its solar capacity to 2 GWp by 2030, supported by comprehensive energy storage deployment after 2025. Solar panels will also be strategically deployed on rooftops, reservoirs, and offshore locations to enhance clean energy supply and bolster energy security.. Additionally, the city state explores partnerships with neighbouring countries for cost-competitive energy through interconnected grids.. To mitigate carbon emissions, Singapore embraces innovative technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen solutions, demonstrating its leadership in combating climate change while ensuring sustainable economic growth.. Singapore is also broadening the scope of its Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) scheme to encompass a wider range of businesses, including those in manufacturing, construction, maritime, data centres, and their users.. Initially launched in 2022 for sectors like food services, food manufacturing, and retail, the EEG aims to assist businesses by co-funding the acquisition of energy-efficient equipment.. .  ",0

Deshalb war am Ende nichts für die TT-Damen zu holen.. Kolbermoor – Fast drei Stunden haben Kolbermoors Bundesliga-Tischtennisdamen dem Tabellenführer TTC Weinheim Paroli geboten. Am Ende standen sie nach einer unglücklichen 2:6-Niederlage mit leeren Händen da.. Krisztina Toth, die einmal mehr Trainer Michael Fuchs vertrat, hatte die Doppel so aufgestellt, dass man hoffen durfte, zumindest einen Punkt zu ergattern. Dies gelang dann auch Swastika Ghosh und ihrer Partnerin Hana Arapovic, die das Duo Wan/Klee in vier Sätzen niederringen konnten.. Kolbermoor zieht in den Einzeln den Kürzeren. Die Einzel nahmen allesamt aus Kolbermoorer Sicht einen unglücklichen Verlauf. So schaffte es Kristin Lang gegen Yuan Wan im vierten Satz, einen 3:7-Rückstand in einen 11:7-Sieg umzumünzen. Im Entscheidungssatz führte sie beim Seitenwechsel noch mit 5:4, geriet dann aber in Rückstand und verlor mit 7:11. Hana Arapovic hatte Weinheims Spitzenspielerin Bruna Takahashi gut im Griff, wenngleich es der Brasilianerin gelang, zum 2:2 Satzausgleich zu kommen. Der fünfte Satz verlief für die Kroatin zunächst durchwachsen, was beim Seitenwechsel einen 1:5-Rückstand zur Folge hatte. Die 19-Jährige konnte aber trotz eines zwischenzeitlichen Timeouts ihrer Gegnerin zum 7:7 ausgleichen. In der Schlussphase stand ihr das Glück nicht zur Seite, was darin gipfelte, dass Takahashi die Begegnung mit einem sogenannten Netzroller zum 11:7 beendete.. Mehr zum Thema.

At the origin of Flos there is a bright thought: the idea of giving birth to objects suitable to change the way of living, not only of Italians. So at the beginning of the 60s a certain Mr Gavina, with the small producer of Merano Eisenkeil, gets in the lead - after having created many new furniture (with the brothers Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Afra and Tobia Scarpa and other masters of design) - that it is also time to create new lamps. So the Castiglioni and the Scarpa, with the cocoon technique, conceived in the USA and experimented by Eisenkeil, begin to make lamps such as the Taraxacum or the Fantasma. Many other lamps, beautiful and surprising, follow these first ones: so already from its prehistory Flos (Fiore, in Latin, name that Pier Giacomo Castiglioni chooses for her) finds himself reinventing the idea of artificial lighting..

ArcWest Exploration Inc.: ArcWest Provides Exploration Update on 2023 Todd Creek Program, Funded by Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc.. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 4, 2024) - ArcWest Exploration Inc. (TSXV: AWX) (""ArcWest"") is pleased to report results from the Company's comprehensive 2023 exploration program at its Todd Creek copper-gold (Cu-Au) project, located in BC's Golden Triangle (the ""Todd Creek project"").. ArcWest's 100% owned, 32,000 hectare Todd Creek project adjoins Newmont Corporation's recently acquired Brucejack Gold Mine property, one of the highest-grade operating gold mines in the world, and is located approximately 40 km southeast of Seabridge Gold's KSM-Iron Cap Cu-Au deposits, which are one of the largest Au-Cu concentrations in North America.. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program (geophysics, geological mapping and geochemical sampling), with an approved expenditure of up to $2.8 million, was funded by Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. (""Freeport""), as per an earn-in agreement announced March 10th, 2023. An updated technical presentation for the Todd Creek project is available for download here.. Highlights. The 2023 Todd Creek program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in British Columbia history, completed by Dias Geophysics using their DIAS32 system. The IP survey focused on a 12 km N-S by 3 km E-W highly gossanous corridor on the west side of Todd Creek valley that is host to numerous Cu-Au occurrences over a widespread area. The survey delineated three extensive zones of high chargeability (25-45 mV-V) underlying or in proximity to areas of known Cu-Au mineralization on the property, including: (1) in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area, (2) west and north of historical drill holes in the Yellow Bowl Zone, and (3) west of the South Zone. The highest chargeabilities were located in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area where a 2 by 1 km zone (open to the north) wraps around a strong 300 by 800 metre conductor (low-resistivity zone). None of the high chargeability zones and conductors identified in the 2023 IP program have been drill tested.. Ice Creek Zone - six new rock samples along a 1 km long north-south trend returned gold values in excess of 1 g/t (grams per tonne), including a sample of hydrothermal breccia returning 262 g/t Au (with 2.46% Cu), one of the highest gold values seen to date on the project. Copper values within the trend range up to 3.43%. The Ice Creek Zone is underlain in part by a coincident chargeability (> 35 mV/V)/resistivity (. Fall Creek Zone - prospecting located a breccia dyke between the A and B zones which returned an assay of 1.15 g/t Au, 0.76% Cu and 80 parts per million molybdenum (Mo). Rock samples from the south side of Fall Creek returned assays of 0.039-3.21 g/t Au, 0.31-3.67% Cu and 2.6-22.5 g/t silver (Ag) in an area with only one shallow drill hole. The 2023 geophysical survey has identified a largely untested chargeability anomaly underlying much of the Fall Creek area (Fig. 2).. Yellow Bowl - Multiple untested chargeability anomalies have been identified beneath variably Cu-Au mineralized, predominantly quartz-sericite-pyrite altered volcanic rocks of the Yellow Bowl target area (Fig. 3). 3D IP results suggest that 2020 drill holes at Yellow Bowl did not test the chargeability anomalies.. South Zone - A significant (> 30 mV/V) chargeability anomaly has been identified at depth to the west of epithermal Au-Cu lodes of the South Zone and newly recognized advanced argillic alteration (Fig. 4). The chargeability anomaly is untested by drilling.. A new zone prospective for massive sulfides was discovered (South Ridge Zone) over two km west of the South Zone in a previously unexplored area. An area of QSP alteration over 2 km long contains massive sulfide lenses in siliceous sedimentary rocks overlying intensely QSP altered feldspar-porphyritic tuffs. Rock samples returned up to 3.96% Cu, with soil samples up to 296 ppm Cu.. Alteration mapping supported by TerraSpec analyses has defined extensive phyllic (muscovite) alteration over a north-south length of 13.5 km and across widths of 2-3.5 km, as well as a number of smaller structurally controlled zones of advanced argillic alteration (pyrophyllite, alunite, diaspore, dickite) in the Yellow Bowl Zone, Pyrophyllite Zone, and west of the South Zone.. Tyler Ruks, President and CEO of ArcWest commented, ""The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in B.C. history. The results of this combined geophysical, geological mapping and geochemical sampling program strengthen our thesis that the Todd Creek property is host to a very large and highly underexplored hydrothermal-magmatic system with potential for the discovery of multiple copper-gold mineralized centres. We are especially excited about the intense chargeability-resistivity anomalies identified at depth in the Ice Creek-Fall Creek areas, where Cu-Au mineralized intercepts in historic core contain previously unrecognized porphyry-like veins and recently recognized, vertically dipping Cu-Mo-Au mineralized breccia dikes contain potential intrusive clasts that have likely been sourced from depth.. ""ArcWest thanks the Todd Creek exploration crew, including Charlie Greig and his team, for their exceptional work on the project in 2023. Dias Geophysical deserves special credit for performing one of the most technically challenging geophysical surveys in B.C. history. We thank Freeport for funding such an aggressive ground program in 2023 and look forward to working with Freeport to advance the project in 2024.. ""Despite difficult market conditions, ArcWest remains in a strong financial position with just over $2 million hard dollars in the treasury, zero warrants, significant insider ownership and an exceptionally low burn rate. Anticipated income for ArcWest between now and the end of the year includes option payments totaling $900,000, in addition to share payments from earn-in agreements and operatorship fees for ArcWest managed exploration programs. The company currently has a market capitalization of only $4.15 million. Exploration budgets are being finalized, with potential for third-party funded drilling on multiple 100% ArcWest owned porphyry Cu-Au projects this year."". ArcWest's 2023 Todd Creek exploration program, funded by Freeport, was a comprehensive, multidisciplinary effort to delineate drill targets across multiple mineralized zones within the 12 kilometre-long Todd Creek alteration corridor. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration included:. Geophysics - completed a 6 by 2-3 kilometre 3D induced polarization (""IP"") survey, using Dias Geophysical's distributed array deep IP (""DCIP"") survey system.. Geology - Geological mapping completed over a 12 by 4 kilometre area on the west side of Todd Creek, with 2,021 geological stations.. Geochemistry - 256 rock samples, 458 soil/talus fine samples.. Hyperspectral - 676 rock samples and 458 soil sample pulps analyzed using a TerraSpec 3 hyperspectral analyzer to determine alteration mineralogy.. Petrography - 16 drill core samples from the South, Fall Creek and Orange Mountain Zones analyzed by an independent expert petrographer..

La nuova lampada di Lodes sembra una nuvola di luce. Margraf, brand di riferimento a livello internazionale specializzato nella lavorazione di marmi e pietre naturali, fonde nei suoi progetti artigianalità e tecnologia, dal retail ai lavorati monumentali, agli spazi di hotellerie. Ne sono un esempio le opere completate l'anno passato, tra le quali emergono Rotas, opera firmata dall'artista Fabio Viale, e l'Hotel Six Senses di Roma.. La boutique di Max Mara realizzata a Tokyo, in collaborazione con lo studio Andrea Tognon, ha invece consolidato la relazione del brand, iniziata da diversi anni, con il mondo del retail di lusso. Qui pavimenti e rivestimenti a parete si abbianno a cemento e moquette, in un'alternanza di motivi geometrici e forme organiche.. Nel 2023 Margraf ha inoltre ampliato la sua gamma di pietre naturali provenienti da tutto il mondo. Accanto al Fior di Pesco Carnico sono state introdotte Polaris Gold, Notre Dame e Basaltite, che abbinano la bellezza della materia alla funzionalità architettonica.. Un brand che punta su continui investimenti anche per quanto riguarda la sostenibilità ambientale. Ne sono un esempio quelli negli stabilimenti e nella crescita sociale e finanziaria: Margraf ha promosso infatti la nascita di un nuovo deposito di blocchi di Carrara e l'acquisizione di un'eccellenza quale Marmi Vrech, e ha pubblicato il primo Bilancio di Sostenibilità..

Con finiture contemporanee e arredi minimal. Nuovo corso per l'appartamento anni '60 che ha scardinato il layout per dare vita a spazi giorno aperti e a una zona notte ridisegnata al centimetro. Con finiture contemporanee e arredi minimal Indirizzi fornitori. Anni '60 sessant'anni dopo, ovvero il nuovo look di un appartamento milanese dell'epoca, ristrutturato solo parzialmente nel corso degli anni '80 e ripensato al presente come spazio più aperto, arioso, che sfrutta al meglio le sue peculiari caratteristiche morfologiche. Novanta metri quadri in una zona residenziale centrale della città, dove il layout è stato oggetto di una trasformazione radicale. Il soggiorno è diventato un unico ambiente polifunzionale, con un'impronta contemporanea e minimal ispirata al gusto nordico.. Nell'open space il progetto decorativo è basato sull'equilibrio compositivo tra il bianco degli sfondi e gli elementi in rovere che ritagliano inserti geometrici all'interno degli ambienti. I soffitti, lasciati quasi ovunque a tutt'altezza (con l'unica eccezione della cucina), insieme ai pavimenti chiari in resina , enfatizzano l'ampiezza dei volumi, anche se la metratura degli interni non è particolarmente estesa.. Nella personalizzazione degli spazi gioca un ruolo fondamentale anche il sistema illuminotecnico, costruito sulla studiata alternanza di luci architettoniche e altre tipologie di fonti, per un'illuminazione d'ambiente diffusa e non invasiva. Nell'intervento sono stati invece conservati i serramenti, già sostituiti in precedenza. Oggi come ieri, ampia via d'ingresso per una copiosa luce naturale.. Foto casa 90 mq. Il progetto: soggiorno con cucina semindipendente, due camere e due bagni. Nell'appartamento di circa 90 mq l'intervento di ristrutturazione ha completamente trasformato gli ambienti, che presentavano la tipica disposizione anni '60, con molte divisioni interne, stanze piccole e bagni poco fruibili. Sono stati quindi demoliti e ricostruiti tutti i tramezzi, apportando significative modifiche rispetto allo schema iniziale. Gli spazi di servizio sono stati riprogettati: al posto del preesistente cucinotto è stata realizzata, in una diversa posizione e all'interno del living, una zona cottura parzialmente a vista; i due bagni, in origine di forma lunga e stretta, sono stati trasformati e uno dei due è ora a uso esclusivo della camera matrimoniale. La zona notte, di dimensioni più contenute rispetto allo stato di fatto, è nettamente separata da un disimpegno che distribuisce gli ambienti; la stanza degli ospiti è pensata per essere utilizzata anche come studio.. 1 Ingresso 2 Soggiorno 3 Bow window-pranzo 4 Zona cottura 5 Penisola 6 Balcone 7 Disimpegno 8 Lavanderia 9 Bagno 10 Camera degli ospiti 11 Camera matrimoniale. L'ingresso si allunga verso il disimpegno della zona notte che si apre di fronte; a sinistra il percorso conduce invece al soggiorno. Di fianco alla porta, sfruttando la profondità del pilastro, è stato ricavato un guardaroba per i cappotti in nicchia. L'esposizione principale dell'appartamento è verso strada, con i due balconi del living e la finestra della camera matrimoniale. Soltanto la seconda camera – con letto a una piazza e mezza e postazione studio, ha una finestra che guarda sul cortile.. Nella zona giorno la profondità dei balconi a loggia di circa 3 mq coincide con quella di un'area in nicchia illuminata da una grande vetrata. Una sorta di bow window al cui interno è stata inserita la zona pranzo.. La nuova zona cottura a vista sul soggiorno ha preso il posto di un bagno. L'affaccio è sul balcone a loggia: le vetrate della portafinestra sono divise da un pilastro portante. Il volume della cucina è parzialmente schermato da una spalla in muratura e da una penisola, sormontata da una sottile veletta di rovere.. I due bagni, uno a uso esclusivo della camera matrimoniale e l'altro accessibile dal disimpegno, sono adiacenti, affiancati in linea. A seguire la lavanderia che, installata nella zona di passaggio, condivide gli impianti con gli ambienti di servizio.. Divano in mezzo alla stanza, tavolo sotto le finestre. Il soggiorno open space è il cuore dell'abitazione, ristrutturata con una nuova disposizione che permette di sfruttare al meglio la luce naturale. Lo spazio multifunzione integra anche la cucina, separata da una penisola. Al centro, la zona pranzo – in linea con l'area living – occupa il volume del bow window, illuminato da una quadrupla vetrata protetta da tendaggi a pacchetto .. Nella composizione d'insieme prevalgono le tonalità chiare del rovere accostato al bianco, con alcuni tocchi più decisi a tinte calde, in stile minimal con citazioni di design nordico. A sottolineare la continuità degli ambienti, il pavimento è uniformato dal rivestimento in Cementoresina di Kerakoll Color Collection. I lavori sono stati eseguiti dall'impesa Edileprogetti.. Nell'angolo dell'ingresso, il mobile su disegno integra la boiserie con appendiabiti, scomparti chiusi e una panca con contenitore sotto la seduta. La stola in lana appesa è Jackie di Lanerossi.. Pareti total white e pavimenti in resina grigia. Nella zona conversazione del living, il divano trapuntato rivestito in tessuto bianco è il modello Tufty Time di B&B Italia, design Patricia Urquiola; il tavolino in vetro è Soda di Miniforms, quello in sughero è Cork Family di Vitra. Il tappeto in lana è il modello Blanco di Karpeta. Nell'angolo a sinistra, seduta in legno Plywood LCW di Vitra. Sulla mensola sotto la tv serie in gres Cicladi di Danese, design Enzo Mari. Gli sgabelli accostati al bancone sono i Fiber Barstool di Muuto.. Il progetto illuminotecnico della zona giorno è stato calibrato tenendo conto, oltre che degli aspetti estetici e delle esigenze specifiche per le luci d'ambiente e quelle d'accento, anche della presenza dell'impianto di riscaldamento a soffitto. Si è evitato quindi di installare apparecchi luminosi che prevedessero di forare il plafone, optando per alternative tali da assicurare anche una migliore diffusione della luce. È il caso, nella zona conversazione, del ""nastro"" luminoso costituito da un cavo a led teso da parete a parete.. Nel living, la madia sospesa a sinistra è stata realizzata su disegno da Falegnameria Rabatto; sul piano, lampada da tavolo nera Panama di Nemo Lighting; l'uccellino nero è House Bird di Vitra. Il sistema di illuminazione su cavo è Infinito di Davide Groppi. La libreria a colonna di fianco alla zona tv è la Sapiens, in vendita da Moroni Gomma; il televisore è di Panasonic. La mensola in nicchia, in cartongesso di elevato spessore, è rivestita con resina grigia di Kerakoll.. Zona pranzo sotto le finestre. La zona pranzo si inserisce su misura all'interno del bow window aggettante, il cui volume è compreso tra le due sporgenze dei balconi, a destra e a sinistra; quest'elemento architettonico è comune a tutti i piani del palazzo.. Nel nuovo progetto, la profondità è sfruttata al centimetro grazie alla panca sospesa in rovere che corre su tre lati (realizzata dalla falegnameria Rabatto, come il tavolo). I cuscini sono Thiene e San Nazario di Lanerossi. L'applique bianca è il modello Tubes Large di Nemo Lighting, la lampada sul tavolo è Poldina di Zafferano; l'alzatina in ceramica arancio è di Raawii. Le due sedie sono le Fiber Chair di Muuto.. CUCINA SEPARATA MA APERTA AD AFFACCIO SUL SOGGIORNO. A metà strada tra cucinotto indipendente e angolo cottura parzialmente a vista sul soggiorno: lo spazio operativo, di forma lunga e stretta, è stato ricavato dove prima c'era uno dei due bagni ed è delimitato da un piano snack passante sotto un'ampia apertura. A definire le diverse funzioni contribuisce l'alternanza del bianco e del rovere nelle finiture.. Al posto di parte della vecchia parete, una veletta e un piano in rovere. In corrispondenza del tramezzo che delimitava il preesistente bagno è stata conserv",1

Applying this way of thinking – viewing something as above, below, or next to something else – to a light source, it becomes evident that such an object should be considered both functional and beautiful from all prepositions in a space..  . When we developed the Volum series for @lodesbrand, we paid particular attention to designing the lid as a crucial part of the lamp's overall visual appeal. By making sure the lid's material properties matched the glass in terms of transparency and finish, we ensured a consistent and harmonious look from any angle.. . 📸: @jformento @multi.form.office @studio.cromo . . #snøhetta #snøhettadesign #productdesign #lightingdesign #lodes #volumseries.

lodes_0000001318207498,"From 1973: Walker Percy on Wilfrid Sheed From 1973: Walker Percy on Wilfrid Sheed In 1973, the famous novelist (and sometime America book reviewer) Walker Percy offered this long review of Wilfrid Sheed's 'People Will Always Be Kind.'. In 1973, the famous novelist (and sometime America book reviewer) Walker Percy offered this long review of Wilfrid Sheed's 'People Will Always Be Kind.' Walker Percy March 05, 2024. Walker Percy (l) and Wilfrid Sheed (r). (Composite image/Wikimedia Commons). Wilfrid Sheed, the critic, has always seemed more at home than Wilfrid Sheed, the novelist. Being at home in this case means doing what you do (or appearing to do so) with zest and ease, playfully. To use a sports image Sheed is fond of, he is like a basketball player who can change his move in the middle of a layup, just for the grace and dazzle of it; he has moves in his moves. Sheed does criticism so well, and maybe so easily, that he shrugs it off. It's nothing, he says, but a couple of insights and a few simple waltz steps. Well, it's more than that when Sheed does it. When he gets down to business, the knife flashes, sometimes the surgeon's scalpel dissecting the tissue of the author's good intentions and occasional successes. But let an author come on pretentious or meretricious, and God help him. The saber flashes now, slash, cut, zing and there goes the jugular.. In his fiction he's always been competent, prolific, improving all the way, at times brilliant but also a good deal of the time rather more dutiful than dazzling. He did all those things a novelist is supposed to do and did them well enough. The reader registered accordingly: yes, good, O.K., right, so…? To get back to sports, you'd have had to rank Sheed the novelist as a classy middleweight who's a pro all right with a good right hand, but maybe there's something wrong with his left. In his early novels particularly, instead of using the simple declarative sentence as a clean left jab, he'd use three or four phrases, dab—that didn't quite get it, try again—dab—a little better, once more —dab….. Sheed does criticism so well, and maybe so easily, that he shrugs it off. It's nothing, he says, but a couple of insights and a few simple waltz steps. Well, it's more than that when Sheed does it.. This time around though, he may have hit on a way of getting at the novel without giving up his big game as critic, the happy slash-and-cut free style. At any rate, People Will Always Be Kind is his best by far, an arresting, complex, enigmatic novel which comes at the main character from two startlingly different directions, leaving the reader impressed and perhaps at the end a little baffled, which is not a bad way to put down a novel. Sheed has, for sure, tried something quite daring. The reader, noting the risks, salutes the author's audacity, then wonders whether he's gotten away with it.. The novel breaks into two parts, as different as dogs and cats. The question is whether, after a dog and a cat are shaken up in the same bag, what comes out is a single creature, which after all is what a novel is supposed to be.. The first part is the story of Brian Casey as youth, felled by polio, a very bright, tough, foul-mouthed, funny and absolutely unsinkable teen-ager, an account unsparing in its honesty, savaging both youth and family alike, but notable especially for shooting down all standard literary techniques for treating illness. Instead of sentiment, we get a Dracula humor. The things that happen to this family are so singular, ghastly and horror-show funny that, paradoxically, the fictional tracks are jumped. Hey, thinks the reader all of a sudden, this is the way it really is! Illness is cruel as every novelist knows, but so can its victims be. Here is the recognizable, nonfictional (and perhaps saving) cruelty of children. Says Brian, who has heard about a new cure, to his already overworked father: ""Couldn't you do some extra work or something?"". For a while it looks as if one fellow is going to be saved, Salinger-style, as a nonphony, laconic good guy. Phil is cynical, sardonic, truthful and so forth, the real article it seems, the sort who (in novels) sticks through thick and thin. But when it gets thin, Phil pulls out. Phil pushes Brian once around the block in the wheelchair, then quits for good. ""It's too much like work,"" he says. Anyhow Phil is honest. And Sheed has got it right all right. Serious illness is not the sort of thing that aesthetic categories easily get hold of. This is no Brian's Song.. Young Brian Casey's story goes on for well over half the book. What's Sheed up to, the reader is beginning to wonder. For he has read about Sheed's own polio. So is this going to be a kind of quirky Sheedian updating of Of Human Bondage, novel as Heldenleben, writer as triumphant over handicap but this time no disguises thank you, no stuttering tricked out as clubfoot. No such thing. Turn [to] page 213 and here comes the shocker. We've jumped 25 years ahead and here's a middle-aged and far from heroic Brian, seen through a stranger's eyes, and doing what? Running for President! (Yes, of the U.S.A.). This is some layup all right, a midair head-fake defying time and gravity. Does the shot sink? It just might. If it does, it's against the odds. For here's Brian a quarter century later and hardly recognizable. It's like running into a classmate at the 25th reunion. The name sounds familiar, but who is this guy?. Sheed has pulled off quite a stunt here. He rescues his main character from his, Sheed's, inveterate ironies and derisions by putting him out of sight.. Something else nags the reader. Sheed knows whereof he writes in both cases—oh does he know—the young Brian dealing with his polio and the young Perkins following a Presidential candidate. Sheed has been through both and has got down to perfection, one has to believe, the feel of both. Is the novel therefore a slap-up job, two valid and vividly rendered experiences knocked together, author mining two mother lodes and mixing the metals and hoping somehow the amalgam will make it? Does it all work?. It works, at least in part. There's a logic in it, a tenuous but indefeasible syllogism strung across the 25-year gap. One Brian leads to the other. There's the classmate 25 years later, and he's different all right, but he's also the same. But here's the best of it: if it works, it works the hard way, not through psychologizing but through the novelist's peculiar logic. The easy way out for the novelist taking on Brian Casey would be to psychologize him, and it might have made a passable enough novel. But Sheed is always one jump ahead of Freud, Adler or whoever. Why not explain Brian, as in fact somebody does in the novel, as an embittered cripple compensating with crazy power drives (Adler)? Or why not see him in early Freudian terms as turning to politics to get women? For in fact the first thing the young Brian does after a small political triumph in college is to go find a prostitute. He feels entitled. And it's true of the older Brian too: the more votes, the more women. There is a very funny treatment here of a girl campaign-worker who could be the heroine, if not of Vaginal Politics, then of a novel perhaps entitled Politics as Eros.. Freud and Adler were probably right but not right enough. Indeed, Part II might be read as the systematic sabotage of all theories, types and ideologies as they might apply to Brian Casey. We see Casey through the eyes of Sam Perkins, New-Politics Ivy-League type in search of a Peace Candidate. Sam Perkins, by the way, may be the most successfully realized character of all. Yet he is sketched in with the left hand so to speak. We see him only through his frustrated attempts to see Casey. Yet, or because of it, he comes across in the round as a wholly believable slightly aging, clean-Gene kid who manages to be both bright and uncomprehending, attractive and repellent, a thoroughly presentable pain-in-the-neck. So here's the kind of inside straight Sheed sets himself to fill: we have to see Casey",0

(2024-03-04 | TSXV:AWX) ArcWest Provides Exploration Update on 2023 Todd Creek Program, Funded by Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. ArcWest Provides Exploration Update on 2023 Todd Creek Program, Funded by Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc.. V.AWX | 1 day ago. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 4, 2024) - ArcWest Exploration Inc. (TSXV: AWX) (""ArcWest"") is pleased to report results from the Company's comprehensive 2023 exploration program at its Todd Creek copper-gold (Cu-Au) project, located in BC's Golden Triangle (the ""Todd Creek project"").. ArcWest's 100% owned, 32,000 hectare Todd Creek project adjoins Newmont Corporation's recently acquired Brucejack Gold Mine property, one of the highest-grade operating gold mines in the world, and is located approximately 40 km southeast of Seabridge Gold's KSM-Iron Cap Cu-Au deposits, which are one of the largest Au-Cu concentrations in North America.. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program (geophysics, geological mapping and geochemical sampling), with an approved expenditure of up to $2.8 million, was funded by Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. (""Freeport""), as per an earn-in agreement announced March 10th, 2023 . An updated technical presentation for the Todd Creek project is available for download here .. Highlights. The 2023 Todd Creek program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in British Columbia history, completed by Dias Geophysics using their DIAS32 system. The IP survey focused on a 12 km N-S by 3 km E-W highly gossanous corridor on the west side of Todd Creek valley that is host to numerous Cu-Au occurrences over a widespread area. The survey delineated three extensive zones of high chargeability (25-45 mV-V) underlying or in proximity to areas of known Cu-Au mineralization on the property, including: (1) in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area, (2) west and north of historical drill holes in the Yellow Bowl Zone, and (3) west of the South Zone. The highest chargeabilities were located in the Fall Creek - Ice Creek area where a 2 by 1 km zone (open to the north) wraps around a strong 300 by 800 metre conductor (low-resistivity zone). None of the high chargeability zones and conductors identified in the 2023 IP program have been drill tested.. Ice Creek Zone - six new rock samples along a 1 km long north-south trend returned gold values in excess of 1 g/t (grams per tonne), including a sample of hydrothermal breccia returning 262 g/t Au (with 2.46% Cu), one of the highest gold values seen to date on the project. Copper values within the trend range up to 3.43%. The Ice Creek Zone is underlain in part by a coincident chargeability (> 35 mV/V)/resistivity ( 30 mV/V) chargeability anomaly has been identified at depth to the west of epithermal Au-Cu lodes of the South Zone and newly recognized advanced argillic alteration ( Fig. 4 ). The chargeability anomaly is untested by drilling.. A new zone prospective for massive sulfides was discovered (South Ridge Zone) over two km west of the South Zone in a previously unexplored area. An area of QSP alteration over 2 km long contains massive sulfide lenses in siliceous sedimentary rocks overlying intensely QSP altered feldspar-porphyritic tuffs. Rock samples returned up to 3.96% Cu, with soil samples up to 296 ppm Cu.. Alteration mapping supported by TerraSpec analyses has defined extensive phyllic (muscovite) alteration over a north-south length of 13.5 km and across widths of 2-3.5 km, as well as a number of smaller structurally controlled zones of advanced argillic alteration (pyrophyllite, alunite, diaspore, dickite) in the Yellow Bowl Zone, Pyrophyllite Zone, and west of the South Zone.. Tyler Ruks, President and CEO of ArcWest commented, ""The 2023 Todd Creek exploration program included one of the largest 3D IP surveys in B.C. history. The results of this combined geophysical, geological mapping and geochemical sampling program strengthen our thesis that the Todd Creek property is host to a very large and highly underexplored hydrothermal-magmatic system with potential for the discovery of multiple copper-gold mineralized centres. We are especially excited about the intense chargeability-resistivity anomalies identified at depth in the Ice Creek-Fall Creek areas, where Cu-Au mineralized intercepts in historic core contain previously unrecognized porphyry-like veins and recently recognized, vertically dipping Cu-Mo-Au mineralized breccia dikes contain potential intrusive clasts that have likely been sourced from depth.. ""ArcWest thanks the Todd Creek exploration crew, including Charlie Greig and his team, for their exceptional work on the project in 2023. Dias Geophysical deserves special credit for performing one of the most technically challenging geophysical surveys in B.C. history. We thank Freeport for funding such an aggressive ground program in 2023 and look forward to working with Freeport to advance the project in 2024.. ""Despite difficult market conditions, ArcWest remains in a strong financial position with just over $2 million hard dollars in the treasury, zero warrants, significant insider ownership and an exceptionally low burn rate. Anticipated income for ArcWest between now and the end of the year includes option payments totaling $900,000, in addition to share payments from earn-in agreements and operatorship fees for ArcWest managed exploration programs. The company currently has a market capitalization of only $4.15 million. Exploration budgets are being finalized, with potential for third-party funded drilling on multiple 100% ArcWest owned porphyry Cu-Au projects this year."". ArcWest's 2023 Todd Creek exploration program, funded by Freeport, was a comprehensive, multidisciplinary effort to delineate drill targets across multiple mineralized zones within the 12 kilometre-long Todd Creek alteration corridor. The 2023 Todd Creek exploration included:. Geophysics - completed a 6 by 2-3 kilometre 3D induced polarization (""IP"") survey, using Dias Geophysical's distributed array deep IP (""DCIP"") survey system.. Geology - Geological mapping completed over a 12 by 4 kilometre area on the west side of Todd Creek, with 2,021 geological stations.. Geochemistry - 256 rock samples, 458 soil/talus fine samples.. Hyperspectral - 676 rock samples and 458 soil sample pulps analyzed using a TerraSpec 3 hyperspectral analyzer to determine alteration mineralogy.. Petrography - 16 drill core samples from the South, Fall Creek and Orange Mountain Zones analyzed by an independent expert petrographer.. A brief summary of significant results for each mineralized zone is presented here. For more details on the 2023 program, including maps, photos and interpretations, a technical presentation for the Todd Creek project is available for download here .. Ice Creek and Fall Creek Zones. The Ice Creek and Fall Creek Zones are underlain primarily by variably altered (chlorite-epidote-pyrite through quartz-sericite-pyrite), locally K-feldspar rich mafic through intermediate/felsic volcanic rocks. Historical drilling in the Ice Creek and Fall Creek Zones included 35 drill holes over a 1.5 by 0.6 km area, with 19 testing high grade epithermal Au-Cu veins (primarily quartz-chalcopyrite-hematite) and breccias north of Fall Creek. Re-logging of select historic Ice Creek core by ArcWest geologists has demonstrated that Cu-Au mineralized intercepts locally contain previously unrecognized, porphyry-like veins. Historical drilling at Ice Creek-Fall Creek tested only shallow targets, with drill holes averaging 132 m in length. Shallow drill intercepts (not true widths) include:. 3.47 g/t Au and 0.73% Cu over 31.85m (88-22, Fall Creek ""A Zone"", 29.3-61.15m). 0.60 g/t Au and 0.25% Cu over 15.48m (NEZ07-01, Fall Creek ""B Zone"", 51.91-67.39m). 1.78 g/t Au and 0.55% Cu over 20.95m (88-47,",0

Modern DNA testing of grapes has unlocked the mysteries behind many varieties, helping to isolate parent/offspring connections and give greater understanding of their origins.. The indispensable tome Wine Grapes (by Harding, Robinson and Vouillamoz) is a fantastic resource in that regard, detailing that syrah is the offspring of mondeuse blanche and dureza.. There have been many hypotheses as to the origin of syrah (aka shiraz), including the city of Shiraz in modern day Iran, Syracuse in Sicily, the island of Syros in Greece, or the country of Syria itself, but it seems probable that the original crossing may have taken place in the Rhone Alpes in France as the grape was already established in France's northern Rhone region by the mid to late 1700s.. The Rhone Valley and Australia (under its moniker shiraz) remained the mother lodes for the variety until the mid to late 20th century when a growing international thirst for French grape varieties saw it planted in European countries as diverse as Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal and Romania, while it also became established in South Africa, Chile, Argentina and Mexico to name a few.. New Zealand's affair with the grape began when Alan Limmer, of Stonecroft Estate in Hawke's Bay, rescued cuttings from a plot (that was about to be pulled up) at the Te Kauwhata research station, leading to his first commercial release with the 1989 vintage. Te Mata followed with its inaugural release from the 1992 vintage. According to NZ Wine figures there are now 344ha planted in Hawke's Bay, with 443ha grown across the country, making it the third-most planted red grape after pinot noir and merlot and more than double that of fourth placegetter cabernet sauvignon.. Waiheke Island is a strong supporter of the variety, and there are pockets in Martinborough, Marlborough, Nelson, North Canterbury and Central Otago..

According to JLL, for the full year, two buildings offered a total of 18,000 sqm (NLA). Scheduled new s Osaka's 2024 new office supply set to be the largest in 20 years. There is 260,000sqm of new supply to enter the market this year.. No new projects entered the Osaka office market in 4Q23. According to JLL, for the full year, two buildings offered a total of 18,000 sqm (NLA). Scheduled new supply for 2024 is expected to be the largest in the past 20 years, totalling 260,000 sqm.. Here's more from JLL:. The 4Q23 vacancy rate dropped to 2.5%, a decrease of 20 bps q-o-q and 70 bps y-o-y. The increase in expansion demand led tenants to secure low-priced space in existing buildings before the large supply in 2024 arrives.. Positive net absorption continues. The December Tankan Survey for Greater Osaka showed that business sentiment rose to 12 points from 6 for large manufacturers, and to 33 points from 25 for large non-manufacturers.. Net absorption totalled 7,000 sqm in 4Q23 and 34,000 sqm for the full year. As the economy continues to pick up, it stimulates demand for expansion, relocation to better locations and upgrades, resulting in an active market.. Rents and capital values decline slightly. Average monthly gross rent per tsubo was JPY 22,497, a decrease of 0.1% q-o-q and 1.8% y-o-y in 4Q23. Some existing buildings competing with new supply in 2024 reduced rents, while a few others increased them.. Capital values decreased 0.6% q-o-q and 3.2% y-o-y in 4Q23, due to the rent decline. Cap rates remained stable. A notable transaction was Japan Excellent Inc.'s acquisition of a co-ownership interest in Grand Front Osaka from Nippon Steel Kowa Real Estate for JPY 8.3 billion. The estimated NOI yields were 3.5% for the South building and 3.6% for the North building.. Outlook: Unprecedented new supply is expected to raise vacancy rates. According to Oxford Economics' forecast as of December, Osaka City's real GDP is expected to grow to 2.1% in 2023 and to 0.3% in 2024. Downside risks include weakened demand for exports due to the deceleration of the global economy.. Rent levels for projected new supply in 2024 are higher than the market average, causing many vacant spaces to be added to the market. We expect that existing buildings will reduce rents to keep tenants. Transactions in the investment market are expected to increase amid the low-cost financing environment, compared to those overseas, and also due to the supply pipeline that has recently increased..

In a report, JLL said warehouse demand in Hong Kong is expected to weaken in 2024 with the estimated availability of marketable spaces remaining high. Although the decline in trade is showing signs of moderation, the pace of recovery is anticipated to be gradual and is unlikely to boost prime warehouse rental rates.. ""Given the declining rents, capital value is projected to continue its downward trajectory, accompanied by modest yield expansion, until the anticipated rate cuts in 2024,"" the report said.. Here's more from JLL:. The global luxury brand, Christian Dior, committed to lease a total GFA of 223,422 sq ft at Goodman Westlink in Tuen Mun.. Meanwhile, Microsoft Datacenter Holdings pre-committed to a long lease of a portion of GDS' upcoming data centre facility, HK2, in Kwai Chung. The facility is expected to come on stream in 2025.. Vacancy rate remains unchanged at 5.8%, mirroring the 3Q23 level. The stable vacancy rate in 4Q23 suggested the limited new demand for warehouse spaces.. The Phase 3 expansion project of DHL Central Asia Hub in the airport area was completed in November 2023, increasing the project's GFA by 41% to 532,813 sq ft. This expansion is strategically positioned to enhance and bolster Hong Kong's position as a leading global logistics hub, particularly in the handling of perishable goods transshipment, an area experiencing growing focus and demand.. Two enbloc transactions recorded in 4Q23. The industrial properties investment market sentiment continued to improve modestly. Primarily driven by two enbloc transactions, investment volume (over USD 5 million excluding equity and land deals) surged by 184% q-o-q in 4Q23. The number of transactions rose from 10 in 3Q23 to 13 in 4Q23.. One of the enbloc transactions was the acquisition of the fourth warehouse by China Resources within a two-year period, from Kerry Properties in Fanling, reportedly for HKD 1.0 billion (HKD 3,854 per sq ft, GFA).. .
